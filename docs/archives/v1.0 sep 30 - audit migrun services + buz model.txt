Migrun helped me to move to Portugal in 2023. Lawyers on the platform were great, overall assistance was also helpful and supportive.
The whole process from the start of docs preparation until getting a resident permit card took about 7-8 months. Not very fast, but this is how Portugal works - everybody is relaxed and you are kinda getting used to it 😁
Highly recommended!

Iskander Galimov

Moved to Portugal with the help of Migran!All the staff I worked with were incredibly responsive and went above and beyond my expectations. It's great that they don't push their services, and instead show you how to achieve the same results for free using their guides. This way, I can turn to their assistance only when I'm unsure or simply want to save my own time.

Alexander Balashov

I've got my Portugal residence permit within 5 months.I've started looking for the relocation options last year. Portugal looked like the best choice. MigRun has an extensive knowledge base on their site, managers are helpful and the process was smooth.Highly recommended.

😎
Stanislav Krasnoyarov

Why choose Portugal as a second home?
... so - the people come first. They're open, they're not harmful, and they're somewhat helpful. The second thing is simplicity. There aren't many places in the world where people act not because it's written in the rules but because of how they feel. And the third is the ocean. For those who love surfing or yachting

I'm incredibly grateful to Polina for assisting me in applying for a Digital Nomad visa for myself and my family. The entire process was seamless and easy to understand. She addressed several questions that had confused me and was immensely helpful when I ran into unexpected challenges at the local print shop. I highly recommend both Polina and the MigRun team.

I received a 3-year residence permit with Mike's invaluable assistance. Despite atypical nuances in my case, such as our marriage in Georgia and complex work experience, Mike expertly navigated these challenges, ensuring we collected all required documents within a month. I'm grateful for his persistence in obtaining the necessary references and agreements, as well as his clear and prompt communication.

Tatiana Kostareva

From the US to Spain to escape the eternal race for success
Very favorite thing is the safety. And in the US, it depends on where you live. In dense urban areas you have to be on your guard, and you have to keep your head on a swivel and know, like, looking behind you, is anyone following you? And here I very much had to de-escalate myself and let all that defensiveness go. It's very relaxing and very nice to be able to let that go. My colleagues have had phones stolen and things like that, but there isn't this threat of just, like, random violence, like this confrontational kind of crime and assault. Here, I feel like the danger is more of just petty theft and non-confrontational.

How applied for a digital nomad visa  while hiking
I was on the road with a backpack on my back. At that moment, Anna from MigRun advised me to legally enter Spain while my Schengen visa was still valid and then apply for a residence permit in Spain as a digital nomad. I had only four days left before my Schengen visa expired.

Migrun helped me to move to Portugal in 2023. Lawyers on the platform were great, overall assistance was also helpful and supportive.
The whole process from the start of docs preparation until getting a resident permit card took about 7-8 months. Not very fast, but this is how Portugal works - everybody is relaxed and you are kinda getting used to it 😁
Highly recommended!

😎
Iskander Galimov

Moved to Portugal with the help of Migran!All the staff I worked with were incredibly responsive and went above and beyond my expectations. It's great that they don't push their services, and instead show you how to achieve the same results for free using their guides. This way, I can turn to their assistance only when I'm unsure or simply want to save my own time.

🤩
Alexander Balashov

I've got my Portugal residence permit within 5 months.I've started looking for the relocation options last year. Portugal looked like the best choice. MigRun has an extensive knowledge base on their site, managers are helpful and the process was smooth.Highly recommended.

😎
Stanislav Krasnoyarov

Why choose Portugal as a second home?
... so - the people come first. They're open, they're not harmful, and they're somewhat helpful. The second thing is simplicity. There aren't many places in the world where people act not because it's written in the rules but because of how they feel. And the third is the ocean. For those who love surfing or yachting

Why moving to Portugal?
Taxes, nature, low cost of living and community
Special tax for IT professionals
Starting in 2024, startup professionals enjoy a tax rate of only around 20%.

Request a citizenship exceptionally fast for EU. This passport is dual, and one of the strongest in the world
Nature and freedom
Diverse landscapes, ocean, cliffs, surfing, and a sense of complete freedom
Cost of living
Portugal offers one of the lowest costs of living in Europe, especially outside of Lisbon.
Immigrant-friendly community
Many locals speak good English and have a welcoming attitude towards expats and immigrants.

I am deeply grateful to Polina for assisting me and my family with our Digital Nomad visa application. We faced a unique situation since my daughter turned 18 last month, leading to additional document requests to verify whether she had her own family. There was also a follow-up inquiry regarding my qualifications and questions related to the company. Polina and the MigRun team quickly helped with the preparation of the necessary documents and wrote explanatory letters. Just a day after responding to the follow-up, we received approval. I highly recommend Polina and the MigRun team for their excellent service.

😎
Siarhei Tamasheuski

I'm incredibly grateful to Polina for assisting me in applying for a Digital Nomad visa for myself and my family. The entire process was seamless and easy to understand. She addressed several questions that had confused me and was immensely helpful when I ran into unexpected challenges at the local print shop. I highly recommend both Polina and the MigRun team.

🤩
Ivan Razhnou

I received approval for a 3-year residence permit. My case had a couple of atypical nuances (we got married in Georgia, and my work experience was not straightforward), but Mikhail helped find optimal solutions for each issue. Overall, we managed to gather all the documents in less than a month before the submission deadline. I want to express my gratitude to Mikhail for his persistence, especially in pushing us to obtain a reference from the company and an additional agreement. He responded promptly and clearly, and all the documents went through multiple checks with him. I highly recommend him!

I was so nervous about moving to Portugal and was almost going to quit my consultancy business from the amount of information, misinformation, vague process, and ridiculous overcharging of lawyers for what turned out to be a simple straightforward process. Victoria was super professional very friendly and patient with her expertise she changed my mind and convinced me to move forward with confidence and I AM. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

I highly recommend this service. Over a month, I explored different options for help. Vlad and his team are some of the most client-oriented people among similar companies. They don't impose services. Feel free to ask the CEO on Telegram. Thank you for the NIF and access to a personal account in tax service!

Work in Portugal legally for a foreign employer or client and get an art. 90.2 residence permit 🇵🇹
As an agent, we hire you in Portugal to work for your employer in another country. You work officially, pay taxes, and get a residence permit in Portugal if you want. You need a diploma and 3-5+ years work experience

How it works
Costs
💼
We hire you in Portugal
It’s an official job contract with Portugal company

💰
We pay taxes and salary
Your employer pays taxes and wages through our company

📄
Get D3 or residence permit 90.2
You can apply for a residence permit under Article 90.2 (optional). Attorneys will help.

Check criteria if you can use this way

You have a higher or college degree diploma / education
Or a mid- and long-term professional education. It should match with you occupation

Hiring request outside of Portugal
You must have an employer or corporate client outside of Portugal

You have three to five years of work experience
and you have to be able to prove it by contracts or another ways
Read how to proove in FAQ →

Fit into occupation categories for a high qualified specialist
Almost all occupation in IT, general management, finance are suitble.
All criteria is here →
Step by step process

Step #1 — Interview with us
Go through the interview process to see if you qualify for the high-qualification program. This is an important step in which we need to assess your qualifications and good intentions.

Step #2 — Pay for NIF and NISS
You can do it all yourself for free with our guides, but if you want, an assistant can help you obtain your tax number. This service will be included in the total amount contracted.

Step #3 — Contracting with your employer and you
Once you have NIF and NISS, we will prepare two contracts: the first one with your foreign employer or client for hiring, and the second one for hiring you at our Portuguese office. Our lawyers have designed comprehensive contracts and documentation, which we will send to you and your employer for approval.

Step #4 — Payments
Your employer or client should pay your taxes, salary, and our monthly commission by the 10th of each month.

If you plan to legalize under Article 90.2 in Portugal, you must start making payments 1-3 months before applying to the AIMA.

For example, for a salary of 2100€ (with taxes) a month, the payment is 2920€, of which 1080€ are taxes. The remaining salary will be transferred to your EU bank account when it becomes available.

Step #5 — Find an apartment and start to prepare docs
While you are waiting to apply to the AIMA, you must find housing with an official lease for at least a year and prepare documents that prove your qualifications and education, as described in the guide.

Step #6 — Prepare for an application to the AIMA
On the correct date, you can apply for a residence permit under 90.2 at AIMA. If you meet all the criteria, you do not have to spend money on a lawyer and can apply on your own.

In a perfect scenario
- your diploma and profession should match, be apostilled, and translated into Portuguese in Portugal.
- you should also provide proof of at least 3-5 years of experience, 2-3 paid salaries (recibos), and social security payments.

In all other cases, we recommend bringing a lawyer with you. AIMAs can vary in their requirements, and you could be assessed by an employee who is not familiar with the law.

At AIMA, they will scan your documents and provide you with confirmation of acceptance. After that, you will wait for your residence permit card. Sometimes, they may ask for additional documents, but this occurs in only 1% of cases. You can find the entire list of requirements with examples in the tracker. →

Step #7 — Family reunion
While you are waiting to apply to the AIMA, you must find housing with an official lease for at least a year and prepare documents proving your qualifications and education as described in the guide.

Say NO to unprofessional assistants with an insane price for obvious information
We see "agents" from BRICS countries providing emigration services without licenses and multiplying the check for relocation 5-10 times more expensive than the same services cost local licensed attorneys.
For example, we know how citizens of India, Pakistan, Russia, Brazil, Ukraine, Mexico and other countries are charged $7-20K for immigration services by non-licensed consultants that cost $500.
It's horrible and we're fighting it.
