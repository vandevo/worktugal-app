My experience with AnchorLess was the highlight of my D7 visa application process [...]. "Rosa" was literally with me in real time, helping me navigate the process and responding to my many questions. I felt like I was in the same room with a very helpful human being! And my questions were not always straightforward, which showed how refined a process AnchorLess has in place! AnchorLess jumpstarted my visa application process and saved me significant time, money, and frustration!

Fantastic service

Fantastic service, very fast turnaround and
getting the NIF was cheaper than what we
had been quoted elsewhere. I had a slight
issue due to a mistake that I had made and
they were really helpful to make sure that
the delay was minimal.
Highly
recommended!

Mrs Miriam, Great Britain

Exceptional

When I reviewed all positive comments it
seemed too good to be truth. But they are
really very good: great customer service,
automated platform , friendly interface. My
NIF was ready next day.

Alina, France

Superb Customer Service

I used Anchorless to obtain my NIF and
Portuguese bank account online. The work
began during the holidays in December
2023 and ended the first week of February
2024 [...]. I heartily recommend
Anchorless. Getting the NIF and bank
account through my immigration attorney
would have cost me at least $1000 more.

Christine, United States

Highly recommend Anchorless
for your Immigration procedures
in Portugal

We found Anchorless on Google, hired
them to process this important document
for us, and... Voila! it arrived TODAY!! As a
former US Immigration translator for 21
years found the speed of this procedure
absolutely amazing.

Alonso M, Canada

The best. As simple as that

This is the second time that I use the
services provided by Anchorless. This time
to obtain my daughter's NIF. The service is
not only quick and efficient but also
painless and effortless which is everything
you could ask for while relocating to a
foreign country. Thank you

Orlando, Spain

Very easy and efficient service

Very easy and efficient service. I was lost -
trying to get my daughters Fischal number
sorted in Portugal, with Brexit making life
difficult. This service was fast and
efficient, it took about 10 minutes and I
never left the sofa!! HIGHLY
RECOMMENDED!!

Daniel, United Kingdom

The company is great to deal
with

The company is great, I had a good chat
with Guilherme who is my contact about
the process and what I wanted to do. So
far setting up the legal requirements has
been painless and they inform you of all
the steps along the way.

Michael, Australia

Highly Recommended

Order my NIF and provided my documents
online, all instructions on the website were
clear and easy to follow. Got my NIF 24
hours after uploading my documentation!
Money well spent! Thank you :)

Guilherme, United Kingdom

Better than helpful

In expecting mediocre, non-personalized help from Anchorless I was, I'm happy to say, pleasantly surprised to be wrong. I'm considering using them again for phase two.

"Going the extra mile" as the cliche says is what this company does and I would highly recommend them to anyone unsure of themselves when it comes to completing the paperwork required to begin the
visa
application process.

Robert, United Kingdom

Excellent service and support

Excellent service and support. We spoke with a representative who had broad knowledge and made it clear how we could move forward, what we could do, and what we needed further support. Technically, everything was friendly, with immediate response. We highly recommend this service.

Orit, Canada

Outstanding Experience

I recently had the pleasure of working with
this company, and I can't recommend them
highly enough. From start to finish, their
service was nothing short of outstanding.

Is AnchorLess helpful for Europeans?

Icon of plus
The NIF, which stands for Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), plays a crucial role in Portugal's taxation system. In simpler terms, it can be referred to as the "fiscal number" or "taxpayer number" for individuals.



In the realm of Portuguese taxation, the NIF acts as a unique identifier, connecting taxpayers to their specific tax obligations. Whether you're seeking to initiate a registration request or preparing to submit a tax return, the NIF is the key that unlocks these processes.

Portugal NIF as Individual



For individuals, the NIF is a vital component that appears on a variety of documents, including income tax returns, corporate tax returns, income tax notices, housing tax statements, and property tax records. It's essentially your financial fingerprint, allowing tax authorities to accurately track and manage your tax-related activities.

Fantastic service

Fantastic service, very fast turnaround and getting the NIF was cheaper than what we had been quoted elsewhere. I had a slight issue due to a mistake that I had made and they were really helpful to make sure that the delay was minimal.
Highly recommended!

Mrs Miriam, Great Britain

Exceptional

When I reviewed all positive comments it seemed too good to be truth. But they are really very good: great customer service, automated platform , friendly interface. My NIF was ready next day.

Alina, France

Superb Customer Service

I used Anchorless to obtain my NIF and Portuguese bank account online. The work began during the holidays in December 2023 and ended the first week of February 2024 [...]. I heartily recommend Anchorless. Getting the NIF and bank account through my immigration attorney would have cost me at least $1000 more.

Christine, United States

Highly recommend Anchorless for your Immigration procedures in Portugal

We found Anchorless on Google, hired them to process this important document for us, and... Voila! it arrived TODAY!! As a former US Immigration translator for 21 years found the speed of this procedure absolutely amazing.

Alonso M, Canada

This is the second time that I use the services provided by Anchorless. This time to obtain my daughter's NIF. The service is not only quick and efficient but also painless and effortless which is everything you could ask for while relocating to a foreign country. Thank you

Orlando, Spain

Very easy and efficient service

Very easy and efficient service. I was lost - trying to get my daughters Fischal number sorted in Portugal, with Brexit making life difficult. This service was fast and efficient, it took about 10 minutes and I never left the sofa!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Daniel, United Kingdom

The company is great to deal with

The company is great, I had a good chat with Guilherme who is my contact about the process and what I wanted to do. So far setting up the legal requirements has been painless and they inform you of all the steps along the way.

Michael, Australia

Order my NIF and provided my documents online, all instructions on the website were clear and easy to follow. Got my NIF 24 hours after uploading my documentation! Money well spent! Thank you :)

Guilherme, United Kingdom

Better than helpful

In expecting mediocre, non-personalized help from Anchorless I was, I'm happy to say, pleasantly surprised to be wrong. I'm considering using them again for phase two.

"Going the extra mile" as the cliche says is what this company does and I would highly recommend them to anyone unsure of themselves when it comes to completing the paperwork required to begin the visa application process.

Robert, United Kingdom

Excellent service and support

Excellent service and support. We spoke with a representative who had broad knowledge and made it clear how we could move forward, what we could do, and what we needed further support. Technically, everything was friendly, with immediate response. We highly recommend this service.

What is a Portuguese NISS?
Relocation expert
It's your unique Social Security number, issued by the Portuguese authorities (Segurança Social). It is mandatory for any professional activity and allows social contributions to be paid by your employer (if you're an employee) or by yourself (if you're a freelancer). These contributions grant you access to public healthcare, pensions, and other social benefits.

Fantastic service

Fantastic service, very fast turnaround and getting the NIF was cheaper than what we had been quoted elsewhere. I had a slight issue due to a mistake that I had made and they were really helpful to make sure that the delay was minimal.
Highly recommended!

When I reviewed all positive comments it seemed too good to be truth. But they are really very good: great customer service, automated platform , friendly interface. My NIF was ready next day.

Superb Customer Service

I used Anchorless to obtain my NIF and Portuguese bank account online. The work began during the holidays in December 2023 and ended the first week of February 2024 [...]. I heartily recommend Anchorless. Getting the NIF and bank account through my immigration attorney would have cost me at least $1000 more.

Christine, United States

Highly recommend Anchorless for your Immigration procedures in Portugal

We found Anchorless on Google, hired them to process this important document for us, and... Voila! it arrived TODAY!! As a former US Immigration translator for 21 years found the speed of this procedure absolutely amazing.

Better than helpful

In expecting mediocre, non-personalized help from Anchorless I was, I'm happy to say, pleasantly surprised to be wrong. I'm considering using them again for phase two.

"Going the extra mile" as the cliche says is what this company does and I would highly recommend them to anyone unsure of themselves when it comes to completing the paperwork required to begin the visa application process.

Robert, United Kingdom

Excellent service and support

Excellent service and support. We spoke with a representative who had broad knowledge and made it clear how we could move forward, what we could do, and what we needed further support. Technically, everything was friendly, with immediate response. We highly recommend this service.

Orit, Canada

Outstanding Experience

I recently had the pleasure of working with this company, and I can't recommend them highly enough. From start to finish, their service was nothing short of outstanding.

What is a Portuguese NIF?
Relocation expert
It's a tax identification number granted by Portuguese tax authorities (aka 'Finanças'), that allows anyone to domicile their taxes in Portugal, and you don't need to be a resident to request one. The NIF is by far the most requested ID for any service in Portugal.
All NIF applications include:
Check icon
Portuguese NIF - you can order multiple at once for your family or group
Check icon
Password for your Finanças account

Check icon
6 months of tax representation

What is a tax representative for a NIF?
Relocation expert
When you are not a legal resident in Portugal, the country needs a point of contact with you in the country to manage your tax responsibilities.
Your tax representative shares their address with the authorities and acts as the official link between you and the Portuguese system.

Fantastic service

Fantastic service, very fast turnaround and getting the NIF was cheaper than what we had been quoted elsewhere. I had a slight issue due to a mistake that I had made and they were really helpful to make sure that the delay was minimal.
Highly recommended!

Mrs Miriam, Great Britain

Exceptional

When I reviewed all positive comments it seemed too good to be truth. But they are really very good: great customer service, automated platform , friendly interface. My NIF was ready next day.

Superb Customer Service

I used Anchorless to obtain my NIF and Portuguese bank account online. The work began during the holidays in December 2023 and ended the first week of February 2024 [...]. I heartily recommend Anchorless. Getting the NIF and bank account through my immigration attorney would have cost me at least $1000 more.

Christine, United States

Highly recommend Anchorless for your Immigration procedures in Portugal

We found Anchorless on Google, hired them to process this important document for us, and... Voila! it arrived TODAY!! As a former US Immigration translator for 21 years found the speed of this procedure absolutely amazing.

Alonso M, Canada

TestimonialEmma, France
The best. As simple as that

This is the second time that I use the services provided by Anchorless. This time to obtain my daughter's NIF. The service is not only quick and efficient but also painless and effortless which is everything you could ask for while relocating to a foreign country. Thank you

Orlando, Spain

Very easy and efficient service

Very easy and efficient service. I was lost - trying to get my daughters Fischal number sorted in Portugal, with Brexit making life difficult. This service was fast and efficient, it took about 10 minutes and I never left the sofa!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Daniel, United Kingdom

TestimonialGustavo, Brazil
The company is great to deal with

The company is great, I had a good chat with Guilherme who is my contact about the process and what I wanted to do. So far setting up the legal requirements has been painless and they inform you of all the steps along the way.

Michael, Australia

Order my NIF and provided my documents online, all instructions on the website were clear and easy to follow. Got my NIF 24 hours after uploading my documentation! Money well spent! Thank you :)

Better than helpful

In expecting mediocre, non-personalized help from Anchorless I was, I'm happy to say, pleasantly surprised to be wrong. I'm considering using them again for phase two.

"Going the extra mile" as the cliche says is what this company does and I would highly recommend them to anyone unsure of themselves when it comes to completing the paperwork required to begin the visa application process.

Robert, United Kingdom

Excellent service and support

Excellent service and support. We spoke with a representative who had broad knowledge and made it clear how we could move forward, what we could do, and what we needed further support. Technically, everything was friendly, with immediate response. We highly recommend this service.

Orit, Canada

Outstanding Experience

I recently had the pleasure of working with this company, and I can't recommend them highly enough. From start to finish, their service was nothing short of outstanding.

What is a lease agreement and why review it?
Relocation expert
A lease agreement is a legal contract between you and your landlord in Portugal. It outlines the terms of your rental, including rent, duration, and responsibilities.
Reviewing it helps you catch hidden risks, avoid unfair clauses, and make sure everything is legally sound before you sign.

Every lease review includes:

Check icon
Reviewed by a Portuguese lawyer

Check icon
Identification of unfair or illegal clauses - (deposits, fees, termination..)

Check icon
Verification that the lease is registered with Finanças

Check icon
Confirmation that the landlord legally owns the property

Fantastic service

Fantastic service, very fast turnaround and getting the NIF was cheaper than what we had been quoted elsewhere. I had a slight issue due to a mistake that I had made and they were really helpful to make sure that the delay was minimal.
Highly recommended!

Mrs Miriam, Great Britain

Exceptional

When I reviewed all positive comments it seemed too good to be truth. But they are really very good: great customer service, automated platform , friendly interface. My NIF was ready next day.

Alina, France

Superb Customer Service

I used Anchorless to obtain my NIF and Portuguese bank account online. The work began during the holidays in December 2023 and ended the first week of February 2024 [...]. I heartily recommend Anchorless. Getting the NIF and bank account through my immigration attorney would have cost me at least $1000 more.

Christine, United States

Highly recommend Anchorless for your Immigration procedures in Portugal

We found Anchorless on Google, hired them to process this important document for us, and... Voila! it arrived TODAY!! As a former US Immigration translator for 21 years found the speed of this procedure absolutely amazing.

Alonso M, Canada

The best. As simple as that

This is the second time that I use the services provided by Anchorless. This time to obtain my daughter's NIF. The service is not only quick and efficient but also painless and effortless which is everything you could ask for while relocating to a foreign country. Thank you

Orlando, Spain

Very easy and efficient service

Very easy and efficient service. I was lost - trying to get my daughters Fischal number sorted in Portugal, with Brexit making life difficult. This service was fast and efficient, it took about 10 minutes and I never left the sofa!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Daniel, United Kingdom

The company is great to deal with

The company is great, I had a good chat with Guilherme who is my contact about the process and what I wanted to do. So far setting up the legal requirements has been painless and they inform you of all the steps along the way.

Michael, Australia

Highly Recommended

Order my NIF and provided my documents online, all instructions on the website were clear and easy to follow. Got my NIF 24 hours after uploading my documentation! Money well spent! Thank you :)

Guilherme, United Kingdom

Better than helpful

In expecting mediocre, non-personalized help from Anchorless I was, I'm happy to say, pleasantly surprised to be wrong. I'm considering using them again for phase two.

"Going the extra mile" as the cliche says is what this company does and I would highly recommend them to anyone unsure of themselves when it comes to completing the paperwork required to begin the visa application process.

Robert, United Kingdom

Excellent service and support

Excellent service and support. We spoke with a representative who had broad knowledge and made it clear how we could move forward, what we could do, and what we needed further support. Technically, everything was friendly, with immediate response. We highly recommend this service.

Orit, Canada

Outstanding Experience

I recently had the pleasure of working with this company, and I can't recommend them highly enough. From start to finish, their service was nothing short of outstanding.
