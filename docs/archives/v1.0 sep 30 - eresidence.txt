Portugal fiscal representative
All non-EU residents including UK expats who own property, hold a bank account or have any other commercial activity or interest in Portugal must by law appoint a Fiscal Representative that is registered with the Tax Department.

The Fiscal representative in Portugal must be registered on their behalf to receive any tax department correspondence and ensure compliance within the legal deadlines.

They are responsible for informing you of your tax obligations, applicable laws and deadlines. Notifications from the Tax Department generally require a prompt response within 10 to 15 days. If these obligations are not fulfilled, it may result in fines, among other penalties.

All non-EU residents must have a Fiscal Representative in place BEFORE requesting a Portuguese fiscal number.

Obtain representative NOW
Please, note, it's Not an Option! If you are not an EU citizen, you are obliged to name a tax representative. If you fail to do this, you’ll be fined from 150€ to 7.500€. Even if you’re living in the EU, there are major benefits in naming an expert dedicated to deal with your fiscal matters in a timely and efficient manner.
