Testimonials
An experience worth writing about

Quick, communicative, and efficient
"I was able to get both my NIF and Portuguese bank account through Bordr. Their customer service was spectacular and the efficiency in their communication was absolutely appreciated. I had contacted 8 other companies/law firms in Portugal and by the time they got back to me, my bank paperwork was already in Portugal. I was able to get my NIF and bank account by the hair of my chinny chin chin just in time for my VFS appointment. I really appreciate the amazing customer service from Bordr and without their diligence, I would have never received those documents in time. Thank you!"

Beyond impressed and highly satisfied
"Bordr has a phenomenal team working to solve a real pain point in the Portugal visa process. The NIF and Bank Opening services were fast, well-informed, and seamless. They were available to answer my many questions during the journey and that sort of service is beyond valuable during these new experiences. I can say, with full confidence, that you should choose to use Bordr for your needs as you navigate the Portugal visa process."

Wonderful experience
"It was a wonderful experience having the Bordr team help us with our NIF numbers. We are both originally from the U.S. and we found the team to be extremely efficient and knowledgeable. They were able to answer all our questions and concerns about the NIF process. The amount of time and money we saved with this company was outstanding and would definitely use them over the alternatives."

Our Story
An entrepreneurial couple in a new country.
Hey there 👋

We're Richard and Kathleen Lo, the husband-wife duo behind Bordr. Originally from the San Francisco, Bay Area, we worked in tech for several years before packing our bags and giving the digital nomad lifestyle a try. We eventually visited Portugal, fell in love, and decided to call it home.

After personally experiencing the challenges of moving to Portugal, we decided to create the service that we wish we had.

Faqs
Frequently Asked Questions
Which payment methods do you accept?
We use Stripe to process our payments. This allows us to accept all major debit and credit cards from customers in every country.

How far in advance should I start the process?
For residence visa applicants, you will need both a NIF and bank account. You will need your NIF before starting the bank account process so we recommend starting the NIF process at least 2 months ahead of your appointment.

You can find our current turnaround time here.

Team Bordr Success
Team Bordr were highly communicative, diligent and supportive throughout the whole set-up process. Guideline documents were simple and easy to understand and the secure portal for uploads was also intuitive and easy to use. Special thanks to Chris Jose who kindly walked me through everything in a friendly and professional manner to ensure a successful outcome.

Everyone at Bordr was friendly and helpful, and with persistence, they helped me obtain my NIF. My only issue (and thus the missing star) is that they have limited options for setting up a bank account, and I was unable to work with them on that piece of the residency visa puzzle for that reason.

So happy we could help with your NIF, Joe! Our team appreciates your kind words.

As for our bank account opening services, we regret we couldn't offer more help. We only offer services when we can meet the standards we aim to uphold, which is also why we’ve decided to pause this service for now.

Your patience and understanding means the world to us. Wishing you all the best with the rest of your Portugal journey :)

I ordered NIF. I get my NIF by mail. I saw three banks to open bank accounts, but it was not successful because Bordr company did not give all documents. After they I asked help me to open bank accounts Bordr company tell we are stop doing that. It's not successful, Bordr 😕

Thank you for your feedback, Alexander. We’re sorry to hear about your experience and we understand how frustrating this must have been.

The NIF document provided is valid and issued by the Portuguese Tax Authority. Many tax offices now issue NIFs without a stamp or signature as operations have shifted online, though we’ve already requested a stamped version for you. However, the Tax Office is still experiencing processing delays due to the summer holidays. We also registered you on the Portal das Finanças the same day your NIF was issued, but the temporary password is mailed physically and typically takes 3–5 weeks. Once it arrives, you’ll then be able to access your account and download your Certidão de Domicílio Fiscal.

We recognize it must have been disappointing that multiple banks did not accept your NIF. In most cases, the NIFs we provide are accepted without issue, though requirements can differ between banks and may change without notice.

Regarding our remote bank account opening service, we regret that we couldn’t assist further. Due to ongoing delays with our banking partners, we’ve paused this service at the moment.

We appreciate your patience and understanding. If there’s anything else we can assist you with, we're just a message away!

Super service, recommended
Relocating is already a burden, but they can give you a great hand. I used them to get the NIF and the NISS. The NIF went straight through, but for the NISS I had some problems due to the social security office procedures. They handled everything, being super responsive and kind.
Will never regret spending that money 😁

Communication was key
Communication was key

The NIF for my wife went smoothly. Mine, which was submitted just a day after took more time. I was stressed out because our appointment at the consulate was coming and we needed my NIF.
I emailed them. They answered quickly and with empathy.
In this day and age of robot and coldness, it was pleasing to read a real humain caring, even if they could not do anything about the delay.
