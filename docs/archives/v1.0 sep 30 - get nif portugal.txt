get nif What You Need to Know About Getting a NIF Number in Portugal
If you’re planning on moving to Portugal, obtaining an individual tax identification number known as a NIF (Número de Identificação Fiscal) in Portugal, is an essential part of the process.

Portuguese and non-Portuguese citizens need this unique identification number to easily navigate financial, legal, and administrative matters in the country with ease. The Portuguese Tax Office, also known as the Finanças, is the primary institution that allocates NIF numbers for the Portuguese government. Explore everything you need to know about the Portugal NIF below.

 

What NIF means
The NIF (Número de Identificação Fiscal)is the Portuguese tax identification number, a crucial element for anyone engaging in financial or legal activities in Portugal. You’ll need it for practically all official matters, including opening a bank account, renting or buying property, signing contracts, applying for a visa, and registering for utilities like electricity and internet.

 

Taxes and responsibilities
Obtaining a NIF is critical for tax-related obligations and legal responsibilities in Portugal. Employers, banks, and the Portuguese government will require your NIF for tax purposes, while businesses, real estate agencies, public utilities, and educational institutions often require it for formalities. Non-residents and third-country nationals may need a fiscal representative to apply for a NIF.

Paying taxes with NIF Portugal


How to Get a NIF in Portugal
The process of obtaining a NIF may vary based on your citizenship. European Union (EU) and non-EU citizens need to follow different steps, but both groups can apply for a NIF.

Applying as an EU/EEA Citizen
Place an order on our website and submit your documents (Portuguese citizens must provide a citizen ID card and a birth certificate for children under the age of 10 who do not have a citizen’s card with the NIF application). GetNIF Portugal processes your request with the tax office in Portugal, and you will receive your Portuguese tax number.

Applying as a Non-EU Citizen
When applying for a NIF number, non-resident citizens of a European Union country will need to provide a scanned and signed copy of an identification document or a passport along with proof of address from your home country. Place an order on our website, submit your documents and personal identification, and sign the provided Power of Attorney. Your signature should be the same as the one displayed on the passport. GetNIF Portugal processes your request with the tax office in Portugal, and you will receive your Portuguese tax number, password, and access to the Finances Portal. Once you have obtained a residence permit or Portuguese Citizenship, we can also assist you with acquiring a social security identification number that will enable you to make social security payments as a Portuguese resident.

Expats and third-country nationals
A third-country national must submit a scanned and signed copy of an identification document or passport, a residence permit, and proof of a non-Portuguese address. If you provide your passport as identification, you will need to include your entry visa for Portugal or the Schengen Area. For minors without an identification document, a birth certificate will suffice. You may also need to appoint a fiscal representative who is a Portuguese citizen.

 

Getting a NIF Without Visiting Portugal
Even if you don’t have a Portuguese address, you can still apply for a NIF for purposes that include buying property, investment, and other business-related matters. The NIF allows you to engage in a variety of fiscal activities in Portugal.

A Portuguese address is not required to apply for a Portuguese NIF number

 

Families and groups getting NIFs
Families or groups can collectively apply for NIFs. Applying for a NIF number for your family members can simplify matters and give them access to work and study opportunities, the Portuguese healthcare system, and the ability to participate in legal fiscal activities in the country.

 

Using your NIF day to day
You’ll need your NIF for everyday tasks such as opening a bank account, buying or renting property, filing a tax return, utilities, enrolling in schools or a Portuguese university, healthcare services, setting up telecommunications, and even acquiring official documentation at government offices. Your NIF number is also required if you’re applying for a Portugal Golden Visa, and for other major business transactions such as applying for loans or mortgages, and companies will request your NIF for taxation and other formalities.

 

What to do if you move to a new address
If you change your address in Portugal, you must update your NIF information with the local tax office. By doing this, you’ll remain compliant with Portuguese government regulations continue to receive important correspondence.

 

What to do with your NIF if you leave Portugal
If you leave Portugal, it’s essential to inform the Finanças to avoid any complications. You will either be required to cancel your NIF or update your contact information if necessary.

Foreign residents can get a NIF for everyday tasks

 

The costs of getting a NIF
The application for the Portugal NIF is free of charge when applying by yourself, but the process of obtaining a NIF may involve certain costs depending on your situation and any additional services. These costs could include a €6.80 service charge for your Portuguese tax card to be sent to your Portuguese address by Finanças, and if you choose to apply for your NIF in Portugal with the assistance of a fiscal representative (also known as a tax representative), there will be charges related to the service.

 

Paying for your fiscal representative
If you’re a non-resident in Portugal, a fiscal representative may be required, and their services come with associated costs. Be sure to budget for this when applying for a NIF. At GetNIF, we offer ongoing tax representation charged at €120 per year.

What is a birth certificate?
A birth certificate is an official document that confirms a person’s birth. A Portuguese birth certificate, also known as a “Certidão de Nascimento,” is a vital record that confirms an individual’s birth details in Portugal. It’s a document that contains information like the person’s full name, date of birth, place of birth, parents’ names, and other relevant details. Fortunately, it’s now possible to apply for a Portuguese birth certificate online, making it easier and more efficient to receive

As it’s an important document, it can be required in official procedures and administrative procedures requiring proof of a person’s identity and existence, such as registering a marriage, applying for a passport, and gaining access to social security benefits. An example of a social security benefit that might be dependent on a birth certificate is receiving child benefits.

A birth certificate can also be necessary when engaging in some official transactions in Portugal. For instance, if you were born in Portugal but hold citizenship of a different country and want to apply for Portuguese nationality or a tax number (NIF), you’d have to present your birth certificate.

Meanwhile, non-citizens born in Portugal might need their Portuguese birth certificates for specific legal or administrative purposes, such as claiming inheritance or applying for residence permits based on birthplace.

A Portuguese birth certificate includes the following essential elements: 

Full name
Date of birth
Place of birth
Book number
Identification number of the national register (or registration number)
Full names of both parents
Date of birth and nationality of each parent
Can I use a Portuguese birth certificate abroad?
The recognition of your Portuguese birth certificate outside of Portugal depends on the destination and its specific requirements. Within the European Union, the certificate typically serves as sufficient identification for basic tasks.

For countries outside the EU, additional validation may be necessary.

Obtaining apostilles and legalisation services from the Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs can authenticate your certificate, making it acceptable for countries that are members of the Hague Convention.

For other nations, it is advisable to check their individual requirements, which may include translations or embassy legalization. If you need translation services, it’s best to ensure the company you work with provides certified translations. It is important to note that the international validity of your birth certificate may vary depending on the destination.
