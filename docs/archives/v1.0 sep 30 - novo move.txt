Legal & Administrative Requirements: Needed to register as self-employed in Portugal.
Local Payments: Access to Multibanco and MB Way for paying utilities and taxes.
Everyday Transactions: Many shops and ATMs don’t accept Visa or Mastercard, so a Portuguese card is necessary.

Why You Shouldn’t Apply for NISS on Your Own
Let’s be real: Sometimes, going the DIY route is just asking for an adventure you didn’t plan for. Even though you can technically fill the online form on the Segurança website by yourself, the journey doesn’t end there.

You’d often need to schedule and attend an in-person appointment at the social security office, and that comes with its own set of challenges.

And let’s not forget the tiny errors that can cause multiple submission problems and result in frustrating delays.

Just listen to one of our clients’ experience

Client Illustration
Before seeking your help, I faced multiple challenges:

1
First off, no one told me my submission was even received.

2
On resubmission, I didn’t receive any confirmation, leading me to schedule an in-person visit.

3
At the office, they turned me away, instructing me to wait for the online process.

Frequently Asked Questions

Who is eligible to apply for a Social Security Identification Number (NISS)?
Anyone who intends to work, reside, or access social security benefits in Portugal is eligible to apply for a NISS. This includes both Portuguese citizens and foreign residents, whether they are employed, self-employed, students, or retirees.

Even those without a current job but intending to work in Portugal should apply for a NISS to be integrated into the social security system.


What is the typical turnaround time for getting a NISS?

Is a Portuguese address mandatory for the application?

What are the essential documents for applying for a NISS?

Do I need to renew my NISS periodically?

What happens if there’s a delay or issue with my application?

Can I track the status of my NISS application?

Is Novomove a legitimate and trusted service?

Have other questions?
Why do you need a NISS (Número de Identificação da Segurança Social) in Portugal?
1
Employment:
If you are working in Portugal, your employer requires your NISS to make the appropriate contributions to the social security system on your behalf. This ensures that you are covered for benefits like unemployment, sick leave, and retirement.

2
Self-Employment:
If you’re self-employed or run a business in Portugal, you’ll need a NISS to make your own social security contributions.

3
Healthcare: Access to public healthcare in Portugal often requires you to have a NISS. While the health system may also use other identifiers, having a NISS ensures you can access services you’re entitled to, based on your social security contributions.

4
Benefits: If you’re eligible for any social benefits, like family allowances, unemployment benefits, or retirement pensions, the government uses your NISS to manage and process these benefits.

5
Tax Purposes: Although the NISS is different from the fiscal number (Número de Identificação Fiscal, NIF), having a NISS can sometimes be relevant in tax situations, especially when claiming certain tax benefits related to social security.

6
Residency: For expatriates or immigrants living in Portugal, obtaining a NISS can be a part of the residency application process or proof of integration into the Portuguese social system.

In essence, the NISS is a key identifier that integrates individuals into the Portuguese social security system, ensuring they receive the benefits and services they’re entitled to and fulfill their social security obligations.

Tax advice FAQs

What’s the difference between tax advice and financial advice?
An accountant helps you ensure that your existing activities are in-line with Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira’s rules and regulations. They can help you make the most of available tax allowances and expenses then help you be as tax-efficient as possible. 

A financial advisor, alternatively, will help you plan financial decisions for your future. They help you grow your business by leveraging trends and helping you strategise new opportunities for growth.


What’s included in the tax advice service?

Can you calculate my taxes?

Can I use the tax advice service more than once?
