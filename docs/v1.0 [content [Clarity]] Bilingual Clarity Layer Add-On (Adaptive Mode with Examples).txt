Purpose

Embed bilingual phrasing only where it adds trust, clarity, or SEO value. The system should detect the article’s context and switch between Official Mode (bureaucracy, finance, law) and Cultural Mode (lifestyle, housing, culture, jobs), or blend them if both contexts appear.

Adaptive Detection Rules

1. Detect Context

Mentions of visas, taxes, agencies, compliance → Official Mode

Mentions of housing, jobs, culture, transport, lifestyle → Cultural Mode

Mixed topics (e.g. “renting in Lisbon for your visa”) → apply both where relevant

2. Apply Mode

Official Mode: insert bilingual phrasing for government systems, forms, contracts, taxes, legal documents

Cultural Mode: insert bilingual phrasing for food, transport, housing terms, job terms, unique cultural concepts

3. Scope

Introduce bilingual phrase once per article (or per section if needed)

Do not overuse or clutter — max 1–2 bilingual inserts per section

Always ask: Does this term add clarity, trust, or SEO value? If not, skip

Format Rules

Always: primary language first, native phrase in round brackets

Example: register your NIF (número de identificação fiscal), pastel de nata (custard tart)

Examples

Official Mode Examples

Apply for your NIF (número de identificação fiscal) before opening a bank account

File your IRS (imposto sobre o rendimento das pessoas singulares) on the Finanças portal

Pay stamp duty (imposto de selo) when registering your rental contract

Schedule your AIMA appointment (Agência para a Integração, Migrações e Asilo) early

Cultural Mode Examples

Try a pastel de nata (custard tart) fresh from a Lisbon bakery

Most apartments are listed as T1 (one-bedroom) or T2 (two-bedroom)

Buy a monthly pass (passe navegante) for unlimited metro and bus travel

Saudade (deep longing) is a word that captures something uniquely Portuguese

Mixed Example (Official + Cultural)

To get your residence permit, you need a registered rental contract (contrato de arrendamento). Many landlords in Lisbon offer short-term options like a T1 (one-bedroom), but for visa purposes only a long-term lease will work.

Do not repeat the same bracketed phrase multiple times unnecessarily

Do not add brackets for emphasis only
