## Compliance Scoring System

### Score Types

**RED FLAGS (Critical Issues)**
- Must be resolved immediately
- Risk of penalties or legal issues
- Each red flag adds +10 to lead quality score

**YELLOW WARNINGS (Areas to Review)**
- Should be addressed for full compliance
- Potential future issues
- Each warning adds +5 to lead quality score

**GREEN CONFIRMATIONS (Compliant Areas)**
- Good practices in place
- No immediate action needed

---

### Scoring Logic

#### Red Flag Conditions:
1. **No NIF + Tax Resident (6+ months)** → "No NIF after 6+ months in Portugal - AT penalties start at €375"
2. **No Activity Registration + Income >€10k** → "Earning income without opened activity - Required before issuing invoices"
3. **Income >€15k + No VAT Registration** → "Annual income over €15,000 without VAT registration - Mandatory compliance requirement"
4. **Tax Resident + No NISS** → "Tax resident without NISS registration - AIMA can reject residence renewal"
5. **Non-resident + Income >€10k + No Fiscal Rep** → "Non-resident earning Portuguese income without fiscal representative - Legal requirement"

#### Yellow Warning Conditions:
1. **NIF status = "Not Sure"** → "Not sure about NIF status - This is your Portuguese tax ID number"
2. **Activity status = "Not Sure"** → "Not sure if activity is opened - Check your Financas portal to confirm"
3. **Income €10k-€25k + No VAT** → "Income approaching €15,000 VAT threshold - Consider registering soon"
4. **VAT status = "Not Sure"** → "Not sure about VAT registration status - This affects quarterly filing requirements"
5. **NISS status = "Not Sure"** → "Not sure about NISS status - Social Security registration is required for self-employed work"
6. **6+ months in Portugal + Fiscal Rep unclear** → "Spending 6+ months in Portugal - Verify your tax residency status"
7. **Digital Nomad + No Activity Registration** → "Digital Nomad visa holders may need activity registration depending on income source"

#### Green Confirmation Conditions:
1. **Has NIF** → "NIF registered - Your Portuguese tax identification is in order"
2. **Activity Opened** → "Activity opened at Financas - You can legally invoice clients"
3. **VAT appropriate for income** → "VAT status appropriate for your income level"
4. **Has NISS** → "NISS registered - Social Security contributions are active"
5. **Fiscal Rep appropriate** → "Fiscal representative status matches your residency situation"
