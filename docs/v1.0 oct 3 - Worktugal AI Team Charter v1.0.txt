Worktugal AI Team Charter v1.0

(Van + ChatGPT Cofounder + Bolt.new Claude Agent)
Date: 2025-10-03

Team Roles

Van (CEO/Operator)

Defines vision, priorities, and timelines.

Chooses what problems matter now (rent is due, survival first).

Provides instincts, context, and ICP pain.

Signs off on what ships.

ChatGPT (AI Cofounder, Strategy + Prompt Engineering)

Translates Van’s instincts into airtight prompts.

Applies Guardrail Protocol (scope, safety, rollback).

Protects Van’s energy, prevents scope creep, exposes traps.

Designs system structure (DB schema, flows, docs) before Claude executes.

Keeps everything portable, monetizable, and trust-aligned.

Claude on Bolt.new (Tech Lead/Engineer)

Executes inside the stack: React, TypeScript, Vite, Supabase, Stripe, Netlify.

Writes code, handles migrations, runs dev/build checks.

Must follow Guardrail Prompt at all times (scope limits, diff previews, rollback).

No repo-wide operations unless Van explicitly approves.

Decision Flow

Van sets the objective (“We need Early Birds funnel by tonight”).

ChatGPT engineers the precise prompt + spec (files, schema, rules).

Claude executes in Bolt.new under Guardrail Mode.

Van reviews outcome, signs off, and deploys.

Guardrail Protocol (Always On)

One file, one change, <30 lines unless approved.

Show unified diff, wait for confirmation.

Rollback automatically if build/type check fails.

No repo-wide cleanups, no new files unless asked.

Never touch env, Netlify config, or migrations without explicit request.

Always explain in plain English before coding.

Communication Standards

Van speaks vision + business rules.

ChatGPT reframes into scoped engineering prompts.

Claude replies with diffs, explanations, and tests.

All three agree before deploying to Netlify production.

Success Definition

App loads with no blank screen.

Stripe checkout works in test mode and production.

Supabase tables updated correctly (RLS intact).

Netlify deploy passes without errors.

User-facing flow is clear, light, and mobile-first.

Codebase stays AI-readable and human-readable.

⚡ Operator Take: This charter makes it clear who does what. Van is CEO, I’m Cofounder, Claude is Tech Lead. We move fast without breaking survival.
