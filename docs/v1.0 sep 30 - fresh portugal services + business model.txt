ON A MISSION TO ENSURE YOUR NEW LIFE IN PORTUGAL IS A SUCCESS
Moving to Portugal can be an amazing decision or go very wrong. 

Not only is the nature of cross-border issues more complex, but also different cultures mean different rules. In Portugal, time moves differently. Authorities have wide powers, and who you know and your attitude matter. 

That's why you need a firm that has your back.

FRESH PORTUGAL is the largest expat legal advisory in Portugal. We help thousands of expat families and our mission is simple: to make Portugal feel like home.

Our services include tax, immigration, investments, corporate, and estate planning. Most importantly, we guide you through a new culture into your new life.

People move for a better life. We make it happen.

If there was a 4.9 stars option I'd still give them 5
If there was a 4.9 stars option I'd still give them 5. We had a short consultation meeting over Zoom regarding our tax planning \ immigration process. Zeev was super knowledgeable and helpful, the meeting started exactly on time and he was clear, informative, creative, and also a very pleasant person to talk to. This company, and Zeev in particular, will be my "go to" place for anything related to tax planning and annual returns going forward. There's nothing negative I can say about their service even if I scratch my head hard and try to dig up something

I’m looking forward to working with Zeev and his team in the future
Zeev was very knowledgeable and explained the optimal approach I should take with my taxes in Portugal. He cleared up some questions that I was unable to have answered previously. I’m looking forward to working with Zeev and his team in the future

Quality tax advice requires spending time understanding a person's individual situation. We created Joana for two reasons:

1. We wanted everyone to be able to understand not just the basics of the NHR regime but also how it applies to them;

2. Since Joana collects a lot of valuable information, she saves us time and makes paid consultations with us more efficient.

Joana is not meant to replace a human tax attorney, but she is a very helpful member to our team and a great way to start

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
NEED MORE ANSWERS?
01
WHEN IS THE BEST TIME FOR TAX PLANNING?
-
Any time is a good time for tax planning, but the best time is as early as possible, preferably before coming to Portugal and before having a NIF issued.

People who are coming to Portugal with a certain business structure will very rarely be doubted, even if the structure is highly efficient from a tax perspective. People who change structures will often be questioned by the tax authorities. Changing structures after coming to Portugal is not impossible, but it's much harder than doing it early.

WHAT ARE NHR AND TISRI?
-
The Non-Habitual Residency tax regime is a 10-year preferential tax regime in Portugal, targeted at people who have not lived in Portugal for the last 5 years. 

NHR is no longer open to new applicants since 1 January 2024 unless they have evidence of starting the process of moving to Portugal in 2023, and it will completely close to new applications at the end of 2024. 

The Tax Incentive Scheme for scientific Research and Innovation (we call it TISRI) is a new scheme that has been introduced in the 2024 budget and has been dubbed "NHR 2.0" or "New NHR". It shares some of the benefits of the NHR scheme but the qualification criteria is different.
See our03
WHO IS ENTITLED TO USE THE NHR AND TISRI?
-
Anyone who has not been a tax resident in Portugal for the last 5 years could use the NHR as long as they applied up to 31 March the year after becoming tax residents, as long as the scheme existed.

TISRI is a more complex scheme with more specific criteria. It is generally open to a few professions as well those who are employed or are executives in certified startup companies. It is also open to some people working on the islands of Madeira or Azores based on the criteria defined by the islands.

04
WHO SHOULD GIVE YOU TAX ADVICE - A TAX LAWYER OR AN ACCOUNTANT?
-
It depends on the type of advice that you want.

Tax lawyers are experts in tax planning. A tax lawyer looks at the sources of income and will suggest ways to utilise tax breaks and reduce the overall tax burden. The advice given by tax lawyers is confidential and remains between their clients and themselves. As experts of the law, tax lawyers are usually more expensive than accountants and charge for consultation.

Accountants are experts of auditing and doing the books. Their primary role is to help their clients with reporting requirements. Many accountants will offer tax advice to their clients . If a tax case is audited, tax accountants have to disclose the advice that they gave to their clients.

Ideally, you should use a tax lawyer for tax planning and an accountant for ongoing administration and bookkeeping
05
SHOULD YOU CONSULT YOUR IMMIGRATION (OR OTHER) LAWYER ON YOUR TAX MATTERS?
-
Would you prefer to be operated by a surgeon or by a family GP?

Many firms in Portugal offer a wide range of services, ranging form immigration, to property, civil litigation and they also offer tax advice.

Indeed, we would expect any lawyer to know "a little bit about everything" but believe us - tax law is really complicated and it is also very creative. So yes, it is easier to use the same people you already know for everything you need, but it is unlikely that they will have the expertise and depth of tax knowledge to give the best advice


06
WHY US?
-
Apart from being tax lawyers who focus our practice on advising expats, we are also an international boutique with qualified lawyers from Portugal and multiple other jurisdictions.  

The reason that this is so important is that the NHR system does not allow Portugal to impose tax in many cases when the other country has the right to impose tax. It is therefore impossible to advise on Portuguese taxation without understanding the systems that interact with it and who is better placed to understand such system than lawyers in these jurisdictions?

When we create a tax plan, we consider how the countries' different tax systems interact with each other, we understand the sources of income and the different forms of incorporation and investment vehicles used by people.

And finally, we offer big-4 quality advice and solutions in accessible prices
07
DO YOU ADVISE EXPATS COMING FROM CANADA? SOUTH AFRICA? AUSTRALIA? GERMANY?
-
We have qualified lawyers in the UK, US and Portugal but we advise expats who are coming to Portugal from all countries. We are experts of reading and understanding double taxation treaties and we have very good familiarity with exit taxes and similar situations.

We do not advise on taxation in countries where we are not qualified but we often coordinate advice with a tax expert in the country that people come from. Our advantage is knowing how to do that - what questions to ask, and how the systems interact with each other
08
OTHER TAX ADVISORS OFFER FREE INTRODUCTORY MEETING. WHY DO YOU CHARGE?
-
Many people don't understand the difference between international tax lawyers and high street accountants. Think brain surgeons vs. a family doctors.

At FRESH, we do a lot as free service to the community. We encourage everybody to join our free FB group, read our free content , use our free taxbot or the free tax calculator.

However, our time and expertise is reserved to our good paying clients
09
HOW DOES CROSS-BORDER ADVICE WORK?
-
When a person moves from one country to another, more than one legal system is involved and often, more than one tax expert is needed.

At Fresh, we normally have a lead advisor whose responsibility is to collect all the facts. This advisor would be an expert in one jurisdiction. Such lead advisor will discuss the situation, as needed, with tax advisors qualified in all the involved jurisdictions

TO UNDERSTAND YOUR OPTIONS IN PORTUGAL
TAX CONSULTATION - PORTUGAL TAX STRATEGIES
ADVISOR: ALL THE FRESH TEAM
This consultation covers the fundamentals of your "moving to Portugal" strategy from a tax perspective.

 

Availability and Urgency

Our consultations are available within days (usually 1-2 days). Once you book, you will receive a confirmation email, which you can reply to. If you do not see an available time slot within the next few days, you may reply to the email and we will arrange an alternative time.

 

How does it work?

During the consultation, we normally consider the following points: 

- The new tax regime (TISRI, also known as IFICI or NHR 2.0): We will explore your eligibility, possible routes to qualify under the new TISRI scheme, and its implications for your income.

- Individuals covered by the historical NHR scheme: The consultation focuses on how to optimize taxes under NHR.

- Missing the NHR deadline and recovering NHR status.

- Taxation of foreign income: We extensively advise people looking to move to Portugal from the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, other EU countries, Hong Kong, Dubai, China, and many other regions. We consider how the relevant double taxation treaties impact foreign income.

- Digital nomads / remote workers

- Cryptocurrency

- Trusts

As well as any other issues commonly affecting expats with assets or income overseas.

 

What is included in the consultation:

A discussion tailored to your specific income streams and how they would be taxed in Portugal, with or without NHR.
30-minute consultation. No written follow-up is included (if you require written notes, please consider our Tax Plan service).
Fresh is the leading tax consultancy for expats in Portugal. We offer consultations by qualified tax lawyers, choosing the one with the nearest agenda available. 

When booking, please provide as much detail as possible regarding your situation. While most of our tax lawyers can advise on a wide range of matters, if your case requires more specialized knowledge, this information will help us assign the most suitable expert.

 

Please wait a few minutes after completing your payment — the general calendar will then appear, and you will be able to schedule your consultation.

FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE STILL NOT OBTAINED A VISA TO MOVE TO PORTUGAL
COMBINED TAX & IMMIGRATION CONSULTATION / GOLDEN VISA CONSULTATION
ADVISOR: ALL THE FRESH TEAM
Most people obtaining a visa to Portugal, either on their own, or with the help of a professional, do not consider tax aspects until much later - sometimes until it is already too late.

We offer a holistic approach that considers not only which visa you may qualify for, but also which one would do the best to your finances!

This consultation is also perfect for people considering the Golden Visa who want to have a solid understanding of their options and tax and immigration implications. 

This includes:

A discussion of your specific income streams and how the NHR regime applies to you
A 45-minute session (no written follow-up included)
2 specialists covering both tax and immigration aspects
 

In response to strong demand, we have created a joint consultation that covers both tax and immigration matters in Portugal. It is very important to understand that the type of visa and the residency requirements in Portugal can impact tax planning opportunities. So, having an integrated consultation that covers both aspects is highly beneficial.

FOR PEOPLE MOVING TO PORTUGAL WITH HIGH INCOMES
PERSONAL TAX PLAN - A COMPREHENSIVE WRITTEN REPORT TO OPTIMISE TAXATION
ADVISOR: ALL THE FRESH TEAM
Tax planning offers a better Return on Investment than any money spent elsewhere.  It is the single best thing a person can do for themselves and their families to create and preserve wealth. A tax plan, designed individually, is created to optimise tax.

Tax planning is also like a suit: no two people are alike, so it must be tailored to the specific individual, taking into account dozens of factors.

It is also similar to an insurance policy: it must be done early. Late tax planning is ineffective and may get people in trouble.

What is the difference between a tax plan and a consultation? 

The main difference between a consultation and an individual tax plan, in addition to having more time and receiving a written plan, is that a tax plan gets at least two lawyers and sometimes more of our team to put our thinking hats on, review your income from various angles and apply creativity to try and reduce your tax burden in any legal way possible. Tax planning is more of an art than a science and it often requires a level of creativity.

If you already know that you are looking for a clear, actionable roadmap, we recommend skipping the consultation and proceeding directly to tax planning.

An investment plan

Our tax plan now also includes a detailed investment strategy for Portugal, covering:

Analysis of asset classes you wish to invest in
Guidance on optimal legal and tax-efficient structures for your investments
 

About the planners 

Tax planning always includes at least two tax lawyers considering your matters - one licensed in Portugal and another one licensed in another country. Our tax planners have extensive experience in international taxation and our firm is recognised as one of the leading tax firms in Portugal and is featured by news outlets and is being interviewed by nearly any expat influence group in Portugal on a regular basis. We combine international experience and multi-national perspective with the secret sauce of successful tax planning - creativity - to create carefully crafted, tailored and brilliant tax plans, adapted individually for maximum tax savings and maximum safety.

What can you expect? 

You can expect to walk out with a clear written plan and a clear idea how to go about your taxes when moving from another country to Portugal. We cover cross-border elements alongside colleagues qualified in Portugal who cover Portugal law.

How much does it cost? 

Tax planning is a tailored service and prices can vary. This year, we attempt to charge a flat fee of 3500 Euros from most tax planners (about 95%). If you fall into the 5% group that has a situation too complex to cover within our standard charge (large group company structures, non-standard crypto earnings etc), we will immediately refund you the fee and advise you of our charge. We do not offer tax plans during the tax season (April to June).

What does it include? 

It includes a learning phase with a review of your personal circumstances, a planning phase and a clear written summary of actionable steps for you to take. The plan will guide you towards the most efficient legal outcome.

Our tax plan covers in detail the opportunities to apply for tax benefits under the new TISRI program (NHR 2.0). 

What will it save me in taxes? 

Most of our clients will save hundreds of thousands of Euros thanks to tax planning. A small minority saves nothing, but at least knows that we exhausted every possible angle to look at their taxation.

What does it not include? 

The personal tax plan is meant for personal taxation of an individual or a couple.

It does not cover:

- Group corporate tax planning (but advising on incorporating companies as part of individual planning is covered)
- Immigration matters (but we often touch on immigration and identify potential issues/overlaps with taxation).
- Other non-tax matters (but we are very happy to give general advice about coming to Portugal or make referrals to professionals we know).

What about implementing the plan? 

We believe that the best actions start with planning and that planning. However, once the plan is ready, we are happy to help you implement it. This is a separate service for a separate fee.

FOR TAX RESIDENTS IN PORTUGAL IN 2023
LATE TAX RETURN FOR 2023 - PORTUGAL ONLY
ADVISOR: REBECCA CASTRO
More info about tax returns:
- Our guide for filing tax returns.
- Our webinar.

One of our most popular services is helping expats file their annual tax returns.

We are often approached by expats who have been consulting high street accountants and received conflicting information. The tax return form is confusing but is easy for a local accountant to fill. The challenge is in the classification of income.

Our 2023 tax return service is the only service designed specifically for dealing with taxes of expats under the NHR scheme, covering also taxes that do not fall under that scheme. It incorporates our interpretation of the most recent case law and dealing with common income streams of foreigners.

Our most common tax return and is meant for people with income streams that include income from work, profits, pension and investments.

Who needs to file a tax return? 

You need to file a tax return if you were a tax resident in Portugal during 2023. You also need to file a tax return if you were not a tax resident but had income in Portugal (such as from a Property in Portugal).

How much does it cost? 

The tax return service for 2023 currently costs 800 Euros + IVA. In addition, as the deadline for filing has passed, a fine can be expected for late filing.

What does it include? 

This service covers 95% of standard tax returns in Portugal. In very special cases where the returns are very complex, such as in the event of multiple capital gains/crypto transactions, more than 2 countries involved or other issues we consider particularly complex, we may need to depart from the standard fix fee, but we will give you ample notification of that.

2025 TAX RETURN
TAX RETURN FOR 2025 - PT + US
ADVISOR: REBECCA CASTRO
The 2025 PT + US Tax Return fee is €1,600 + VAT. Pay €150 + VAT as a deposit, and by the end of the year, you will need to pay the amount of €1450 + VAT for the tax return.

For one person or a couple?

The price is for a tax return. If you are eligible to file jointly, it's for a joint return. If you are not, it's for an individual return. Note the difference between Portugal (common law partners can file jointly) and the US (only married couples can file jointly).

Who needs to file a tax return in Portugal?

You need to file a tax return in Portugal if you were a tax resident in Portugal during 2025. You also need to file a tax return if you were not a tax resident but had income in Portugal (such as from a Property in Portugal).

Who needs to file a tax return in the U.S.?

You need to file a tax return in the U.S. if you are a US citizen, green card holder, a resident or have U.S. sourced income. U.S. citizens living in Portugal normally need to file taxes in both countries.

How much does it cost?

Our typical tax return in both countries costs 1,800 Euros + VAT (if applicable). We will advise you if your tax return is not "typical" and offer a full refund in such a case. 

What does it include?

This service includes most tax returns in Portugal and the U.S. Essentially, it is a matter of complexity and if your tax return is more complex than a normal one, we will inform you what the price would be and offer a full refund if you are not interested.

This service includes FBAR filing up to 5 accounts.

The US return is filed by a consultant and although closely aligned, you will work with two different teams.

 

What does it not include?

Examples of complex tax returns where we will need to readjust the price:

Any corporate tax returns (including US LLCs)
Foreign company reporting in the US / CFCs.
Large amount (over 15) of capital gains transactions
Crypto
Large amount (3+) of K1s or other similar forms
State taxes
Complex coordination requiring tax estimates for the other country
FATCA filing

FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED AN ESTATE PLAN
ESTATE PLANNING / WILL - PORTUGAL
ADVISOR: DANIEL RUSSO
For more info about this service, check out this video and guide. 

Most expats coming to Portugal do not realise that if they do not adapt their estate plan to Portugal, their will may not be respected and Portugal could enforce the division of their assets in a way that is different to what they want or intend. 
The general rule in Portugal is that Portuguese law applies to succession, but foreigners may elect to use the law of their home country. However, failing to make such an election (normally, by having a will signed in front of a notary in Portugal) will normally lead to Portuguese law applying and Portuguese law does not allow people to freely decide how to distribute their assets. Instead, only some of the assets could be distributed based on the person's choice and the rest of the distribution is forced by the state. This all but guarantees a conflict between successors, since inevitably some successors will have an interest to use Portuguese law. 

We therefore strongly recommend, as a bare minimum, a will that opts out of Portuguese law and apply the foreign law in such cases where foreign law offers flexibility and respects the person's intentions.

This service includes: 
- A consultation 
- Creating an "opt out" will in Portugal.
- Coordinating a meeting with a notary to sign the will. 

This service does not include: 
- Witnessing the will (this could be provided at an extra cost)
- Serving as translators (this could also be provided at an extra cost)
- Notary fees and government fees.
- Comprehensive advice on foreign law, coordination with foreign advisors. These could be provided at extra cost. 

Cost:

TAX RETURN - 2024
LATE TAX RETURN FOR 2024 - PORTUGAL ONLY 
ADVISOR: REBECCA CASTRO
Update - we are out of capacity to file tax returns by the June 30, 2025 deadline. We can still file your tax return but it will be into July and may incur a small fine. We are currently accepting a waiting list. If we will believe that we can manage to file still in June, we will let you know. 

One of our most popular services is helping expats file their annual tax returns.

We are often approached by expats who have been consulting high street accountants and received conflicting information. The tax return form is confusing but is easy for a local accountant to fill. The challenge is in the classification of income.

Our 2024 tax return service is the only service designed specifically for dealing with taxes of expats under the NHR scheme, covering also taxes that do not fall under that scheme. It incorporates our interpretation of the most recent case law and dealing with common income streams of foreigners.

Our most common tax return and is meant for people with income streams that include income from work, profits, pension and investments.

Who needs to file a tax return? 

You need to file a tax return if you were a tax resident in Portugal during 2024. You also need to file a tax return if you were not a tax resident but had income in Portugal (such as from a Property in Portugal).

How much does it cost? 

The tax return service for 2024 currently costs 800 Euros + IVA. In addition, as the deadline for filing has passed, a fine can be expected for late filing.

What does it include? 

This service covers 95% of standard tax returns in Portugal. In very special cases where the returns are very complex, such as in the event of multiple capital gains/crypto transactions, more than 2 countries involved or other issues we consider particularly complex, we may need to depart from the standard fix fee, but we will give you ample notification of that.

TAX RETURN - 2024
PORTUGAL + US TAX RETURN - 2024
ADVISOR: REBECCA CASTRO
, US CPA/EA
We are now offering again a combined tax return service for both Portugal and the US.

 

For one person or a couple?

The price is for a tax return. If you are eligible to file jointly, it's for a joint return. If you are not, it's for an individual return. Note the difference between Portugal (common law partners can file jointly) and the US (only married couples can file jointly).

Who needs to file a tax return in Portugal?

You need to file a tax return in Portugal if you were a tax resident in Portugal during 2024. You also need to file a tax return if you were not a tax resident but had income in Portugal (such as from a Property in Portugal).

 

Who needs to file a tax return in the U.S.?

You need to file a tax return in the U.S. if you are a US citizen, green card holder, a resident or have U.S. sourced income. U.S. citizens living in Portugal normally need to file taxes in both countries.

 

How much does it cost?

Our typical tax return in both countries costs 1,800 Euros + VAT. We will advise you if your tax return is not "typical" and offer a full refund in such a case.

 

What does it include?

This service includes most tax returns in Portugal and the U.S. Essentially, it is a matter of complexity and if your tax return is more complex than a normal one, we will inform you what the price would be and offer a full refund if you are not interested.

This service includes FBAR filing up to 5 accounts.

The US return is filed by a consultant and although closely aligned, you will work with two different teams.

 

What does it not include?

Examples of complex tax returns where we will need to readjust the price:

Any corporate tax returns (including US LLCs)
Foreign company reporting in the US / CFCs.
Large amount (over 15) of capital gains transactions
Crypto
Large amount (3+) of K1s or other similar forms
State taxes

3IFICI / NHR 2.0 – Tax Guide 
for Expats in Portugal
(updated 2025)
March 7, 2025
This article is a practical guide to the new tax regime for people moving to Portugal, called IFICI by the government or in its popular name NHR 2.0. You may have also seen the name TISRI and abbreviation of Tax Incentive Scheme for scientific Research and Innovation. These are all different names for the same regime.

The tax regime has existed in the legislation of Portugal since January 2024 but it has only been fully and properly activated now, in March 2025, as we write this guide, with retroactive effect. 

The highlights of this article will also be released in a video and a webinar that we will be creating shortly.
What is IFICI / NHR 2.0 – new a scheme of benefits for people moving to Portugal?
After an announcement of the imminent end of the previous tax benefits scheme, NHR, with a short notice, the government of Portugal has been heavily criticized for removing a scheme that had done so much to support the Portuguese economy.

In response, the government created IFICI, a new scheme which in many ways resembles the previous scheme but with some notable changes. As before, IFICI is a scheme that is meant for NEW tax residents in Portugal, but it is also open to Portuguese people who left the country and came back after 5 years of absence. In other words, the scheme is open to people who were not tax residents in Portugal for the last 5 years. It is not open to people who benefited from the NHR scheme. 

The IFICI status can be maintained for up to 10 years so long that the taxpayer continues to meet the qualification conditions. After 10 years, it ends and the taxpayer needs to pay standard tax rates. 
What are the benefits of IFICI / NHR 2.0?
The primary benefits of the IFICI are a reduced tax rates on certain types of income and a full exemption on other types.
Employment and self-employment income generated in Portugal
Qualifying employment and self-employment income may elect to benefit from a special tax rate of 20% if the income was generated in Portugal (i.e. for work that had been done in Portugal). It is important to remember that social security is still due in addition to income tax.
Employment and self-employment income generated outside Portugal
Under the new scheme, foreign sourced income derived from employment and self-employment (for work done physically outside Portugal) will be exempt from tax in Portugal, as long as they do not come from a black-listed jurisdiction.
It is important to remember that when we talk about income from work, it is the place where the work is done that dictates if the income is foreign-sourced or not, and not the location of the employer. A remote worker working from Portugal is generating Portuguese sourced income and is subject to tax in Portuga
Foreign-sourced income from passive sources (except pension)
In addition, foreign sourced income (income coming from outside Portugal) from that is not derived from work, including capital gains, capital income (dividends, royalties, interest) and real estate income, are fully exempt from tax in Portugal, so long as they do not come from a black-listed jurisdiction. 
Retirement income / pension /li]
it is important to note that pension income and many types of income from retirement accounts that fall under the definition of pension in Portugal is outside the scope of IFICI and is fully taxable in Portugal at progressive rates.
What are the benefits of IFICI / NHR 2.0?
The winners – foreigners with capital gains from securities, such as startup founders or service business owners exiting their foreign companies. 

IFICI, unlike NHR, does not include a condition for the exemption of foreign income requiring such income to be potentially taxable in the other country. This means that capital gains from a foreign source, including in relation to securities, are fully exempt in Portugal under the legal criteria set out in IFICI.

The primary winners are therefore both investors who hold a portfolio of securities and anyone holding shares in a foreign company who expects a liquidity event in the future.

The losers - It has been extensively highlighted in the media that IFICI does not include any benefits covering pension income. Indeed, pension income is not covered by IFICI and is subject to full progressive taxation. The pensioners are therefore the main losers of the new scheme.
Who qualifies for IFICI / NHR 2.0?
To qualify for IFICI, a new taxpayer should have not been a tax resident in Portugal in the last 5 years. In addition, anyone who benefits from NHR status or IRS Jovem cannot apply for IFICI.

The original proposal for IFICI included only a few narrow groups, including research workers with a Ph.D., certain senior roles in the financial industry, professors in university.

However, following criticism, the government significantly extended the eligibility criteria to include additional groups:

Those who work for or members of the statutory bodies of certified startup companies.
Those working in Madeira/Azores, with the criteria for eligibility to be defined by the respective local autonomous governments. 

We can resume it through the following eligibility paths: 
1.
The startup route – IFICI for people working for / members of the statutory bodies of certified startup companies
Certifying entity: Startup Portugal

This broad criterion has been drafted to include anyone working for a certified startup company, regardless of their position or experience. In addition, the legislation includes anyone on the management body (e.g. board) of such a startup company. 
Importantly, not all the income of the taxpayer needs to come from the certified startup. It is sufficient that the startup would pay a reasonable salary and the remaining income of the taxpayer can come from other sources.

The primary obstacle is that the startup needs to be “certified”. Otherwise, the benefits do not apply.[/li]
Joining a startup that is already certified
The easiest way to obtain a role in a certified startup is join a startup that has already obtained the required certification. 

When the legislation originally passed in early 2024, at FRESH we identified the opportunity that this presents to startups in Portugal and have been advocating loudly within the ecosystem that startups should seek certification. And indeed, there is growing excitement in the Portuguese startup ecosystem about working with talented expats who have skills, contacts and capital. Working with local incubators, accelerators and VC funds, we have been expanding our network of already-certified startups that are happy and open to collaborate with expats.  
We believe that this is the best route available today to qualifying under the IFICI scheme quickly and also add the most value to Portugal and its economy. 

Since the law grants status not only to employees but also to members of the statutory bodies, it will be possible to access the benefits by adding enough value to a startup, normally by making an angel investment in a certified startup and taking a board seat in that startup. 

People who do not have angel investment experience but will find supporting Portuguese startups and taking an active role in them to be a fantastic experience and that is very much what the government is looking to encourage.
Certifying your own startup
If an expat intends to set up their own tech startup company, another option is to certify one’s own startup. 

There are a number of routes for a startup to be certified. Firstly, any startup who received an investment from a certified VC or a certified angel investor or angel group is automatically a certified startup. The VC or the angel need to be certified in Portugal, so qualifying under these criteria requires some external investment. 

Another option for certification is via a combination of an approval from ANI and an endorsement of a startup incubator. The startup can also elect to be certified directly by one of two different bodies – one of them is Startup Program and the procedure for startup certification is already working.
At FRESH, we work with VC funds, as well as incubators and we have extensive experience certifying startups via all these routes.
2.
Export Companies - IFICI for people having certain activities and working for companies that are focused on export 
Certifying entity: Tax Authority

Another route for qualification for IFICI involves the creation of a company that exports 50% or more of its turnover in one of the following fields:

Transformative Industries: Manufacturing and related activities (Divisions 10-33 of CAE).
Scientific R&D: Physical and natural sciences research (Group 721).
Information and Communication Technologies: Activities within Divisions 58-63.
Higher Education and Health Services: Subcategories related to university teaching and advanced medical services

Then, the benefits are offering to people in the following professions with at least a bachelor's degree and 3 years of proven experience, or a Ph.D. with no experience requirement:

Directors of companies and specialized service departments.
Experts in physical sciences, engineering, and IT.
Medical professionals and university professors.
Other roles requiring advanced technical qualifications.

In other words, to qualify under the export companies’ route, the taxpayer’s company should be in one of the trade areas mention above AND the expat himself should have a high value activity role AND at least a bachelor’s degree and 3 years of proven experience.
3.
Companies that are important to the national economy – IFICI for people working in certain companies and professions
Certifying entity: IAPMEI / AICEP

Another route to IFICI involves working within entities engaged in economic activities recognized as relevant to the national economy, particularly those aimed at attracting productive investment and reducing regional disparities.

In order to regulate the IFICI framework in detail, IAPMEI (up to 75M Euro) and AICEP (beyond 75M Euro) —agencies responsible for economic development in Portugal—have issued specific ordinances outlining the criteria to be considered for IFICI applications within their respective areas of competence. Below is a sum up of the criteria. 
Eligibility Requirements:
The professionals must perform activities listed as “qualified jobs”
 Examples include:
- General managers and executive directors
- Specialists in physical sciences, mathematics, engineering, and IT
 - Medical doctors
- University professors
 - Finance and accounting specialists
- Directors in hospitality, production, and administrative services
The company must operate within “relevant economic sectors”
Industries recognized for their contribution to investment and regional development, such as:
- Extractive industries
- Manufacturing
- Energy production and distribution
- Construction
- Information and communication
- Finance and insurance
- Scientific research and consultancy
- Health and social care

Additionally, activities within projects recognized as Projects of Potential National Interest (PIN) or Interior Investment Projects (PII) are also eligible.
Individuals must hold at least Level 5 under the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) or International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) – which corresponds to a post-secondary/bachelor degree. No need to prove experience.
For regulated professions, compliance with applicable legislation is mandatory.
Additional information may be requested by IAPMEI or AICEP, referring to the eligibility and the company/position details. 
4.
People who move to Madeira/Azores (doesn’t work yet)
At the time of writing this article, the autonomous governments of Madeira and Azores are yet to define a criterion but considering the political orientation of these governments and the different approach that the islands have taken, historically, it is likely that the criteria will be wide and may include anyone living and working on the islands, including remote workers. In other words, the most likely outcome is NHR-alike benefits for anyone living on the islands and not retired. We will continue to follow this matter and update this guide accordingly. However, for now, there are no specific benefits for those moving to the islands.
5.
Scientific/Innovation Research and Academical Roles 
Another pathway to obtaining IFICI is based on a slightly more restrictive criterion, aimed at highly qualified professions and positions, particularly in research and development roles within Portuguese academic and research institutions. The criteria are divided as follows:
Teaching and scientific research, including scientific employment in higher education institutions:
Entities, structures, and networks dedicated to the production, dissemination, and transmission of knowledge, integrated into the national science and technology system.
Positions directly involved in scientific research or innovation:
Members of governing bodies of entities recognized as technology and innovation centers, certified as such by the National Innovation Agency (ANI).
In this case, the IFICI certification is carried out by the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT).
IFICI / NHR 2.0 – How to Apply - General Guidelines for the Application Process:
Applications are always submitted via the Tax Authority’s portal. This is contrary to previous information provided by the government that applications will be submitted to the certifying authority. 
Applicants must register for the IFICI regime by January 15 of the year following the fiscal year in which they establish residency in Portugal (except for income earned in 2024 – the deadline in 2025 is March 30). Depending on the nature of their activity, applications are the sent (by the tax authority) to one of several competent entities, including:
- The Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT): For higher education and scientific research.
- The Portuguese Trade & Investment Agency (AICEP): For qualified positions under investment incentive agreements.
- The Portuguese Tax Authority (AT): For highly skilled professionals in companies with significant investments or export-driven revenue.
- IAPMEI: For activities considered essential to the national economy.
- The National Innovation Agency (ANI): For R&D projects eligible for tax incentives.
- Startup Portugal: For roles within certified startups.
Applicants are required to maintain detailed documentation to verify their eligibility, which must be presented to the Tax Authority upon request.
By January 15 of the following year, beneficiaries must report any changes in their eligibility through the Tax Authority Portal by logging in, completing the appropriate form, and submitting it along with the necessary supporting documents for review, whenever:

The requirements for benefiting from the regime are no longer met; or
There is a change in the information provided at the time of registration.

If the reported change concerns the commencement of a new activity covered by the regime, the right to the benefit remains valid, provided that the new activity begins within a maximum period of six months after the termination of the previously exercised activity.
And what about the pensioners?
For income earned in 2024, the following deadlines apply:

Application submission: By March 30, 2025.
Certification by relevant entities: By April 15, 2025.
IFICI / NHR 2.0 – When to Apply? Key Deadlines
We urge pensioners not to panic. Whilst social security (US) / state pension (UK) will indeed be taxed using the progressive rates system, savvy expats who would switch their portfolio from pension products to investment products that are not pension, alongside meeting the qualification criteria of IFICI will be able to enjoy a full exemption of their foreign-sourced income. 

We strongly recommend people not to make life-changing decisions such as where to live and where to move based on rumors or internet memes and to consider quality advice on the subject. 
Next steps
On its face, IFICI is more complex than NHR but here at FRESH, we work tirelessly to make it simple. We already have significant infrastructure to support anyone wishing to move to Portugal and continue to enjoy tax benefits. 

We are glad to say that the door of Portugal remains wide open and with excellent VISA opportunities, an attractive tax scheme that is even better for some than the previous one, and the famous beaches, great food and wonderful climate.

To move forward, we recommend booking a consultation.

SIGN UPNHR 2.0 COMPLIANT GOLDEN VISA BY FRESH PORTUGAL
March 7, 2025
Portugal's Golden Visa is the most popular in the world
Portugal's Golden Visa program is Europe's (and the world's) most successful residency-by-investment for non-EU citizens. 

Unlike other programs, it requires only 14 days of stay every two years, consecutive or nonconsecutive.

After only 5 years within the program, investors can apply for Portuguese citizenship and obtain an EU passport. 

Our team provides full bureaucratic and legal assistance with the process, and we shall be happy to guide you through this new chapter!
BOOK THE INTRODUCTORY MEETING
The FRESH Portugal investment program is the only one offering access to NHR 2.0 tax benefits for those who decide to move to Portugal
Historically, many Golden Visa applicants never intended to actually move to Portugal. However, with the growing political uncertainty in the world and the rise of the popularity of Portugal as a great place to live, more and more people want to keep the door open to actually moving to Portugal. 

For those, access to tax benefits whilst living in Portugal is extremely important, but in contrast to the previous NHR program that offered immediate tax benefit to anyone moving to Portugal, the new NHR 2.0 includes a qualification criteria that needs to be met. 

We therefore designed the only Golden Visa program in the market that includes meeting the qualification criteria for NHR 2.0, also known as TISRI or IFICI.

For those who consider moving to Portugal at some point, we developed at FRESH Portugal, in collaboration with select funds, a unique GV investment program that gives GV applicants a great deal of flexibility in choosing their investment vehicles, but also facilitate the new system of tax benefits, called IFICI (TISRI in English, or NHR 2.0 as popularly known. As of early 2025, we offer the ONLY GV program that is compliant with the requirements for IFICI. 
The best and safest investment
Following the removal of the primary route to Golden Visa, the real estate route, many actors who were focusing on real estate moved to offer other Golden Visa options, often without relevant experience. 

Others have been offering products that are dubious and not necessarily compliant with the rules.

At FRESH, we are committed to offering you well-screened investment options and work with relevant experts in each fields.

As lawyers (regulated in multiple jurisdictions), we take a cautious approach and only work with investment providers that are on solid grounds. 

However, we don't stop there. At FRESH, we are deeply integrated in the investment scene in Portugal. We brought in a compliance officer of several funds, a Venture Capitalist and made investments into both real estate and tech as a firm. We have a deep bench that analyses the investment propositions made by the different funds and identify and holes or weaknesses, helping you to choose the investment that is best suitable for you.
Incorporation of a company that creates at least 10 job positions;
A transfer of capital for research activities carried out by public or private scientific institutions that are part of the national scientific and technological system must be €500,000 or greater;
Capital transfers of €250,000 or more can be made to support the investment or artistic production, recovery, and maintenance of national cultural heritage through public institutes and central or peripheral direct administration services, entities in the public business sector, public foundations, private foundations with public utility status, inter-municipal entities, entities in the local business sector, municipal associative entities and public cultural associations, which develop projects related to artistic production or the recovery and maintenance of the national cultural heritage;
Capital transfers in the amount equal to or greater than €500,000, intended for acquiring participation units in investment funds (non-real estate collective investment entities) or venture capital funds focused on the capitalization of companies, constituted under the Portuguese legislation, with maturity, at the time of the investment, of at least five years and at least 60%. of the value of the investment is made in commercial companies based in national territory;
Capital transfers in the amount equal or superior to €500,000, destined to the incorporation of a commercial company with headquarters in the national territory, combined with the creation of five permanent jobs, or to increase the share capital of a commercial company with headquarters in the national territory, already existing, with the creation of five permanent jobs or maintenance of 5 permanent jobs, for a minimum period of three years. Moreover, investments made in low-density areas entail a 20% reduction in the required investment value.
Golden Visa Timeline:
Online pre-approval – 6 to 12 months
Immigration Office´s appointment - around 6 months after the online pre-approval
Final analysis and issuance of the residence card – 6 months

Once the investment is chosen and fully paid, you can officially start the Golden Visa process by submitting all documents related to the investment and the applicant’s personal documents online through AIMA’s Golden Visa platform.

After the online submission, as mentioned above, the Immigration Office is currently taking around 6 to 12 months to complete the first analysis and issue the pre-approval.

Once the submission has been accepted and approved, the legal representatives will be notified to schedule an appointment with AIMA to collect the applicant’s biometrics and to provide the original documents that were submitted on the online Golden Visa platform at the beginning.

The booking of the appointment depends on the Immigration Office’s agenda and availability. The waiting period for an appointment is currently 6 months.

After the appointment with AIMA, the Portuguese Authorities will grant the final approval and proceed with the issuance of the residence card (also in approximately 6 months).
What are the options after 5 years?
At the end of the 5th year, the Golden Visa holder can pursue one of the following options:

Renew the Golden Visa every 2 years, for which the investment must be kept in place.
Apply for “permanent residency for investment”, subject to passing A2 Portuguese language test, or
Apply for Portuguese citizenship, also subject to passing the A2 Portuguese language test.

To clarify any questions regarding the Golden Visa, you can now book a short 15-minute introductory meeting.

I must admit I don't understand how the Portugal tax return works so I am glad for your knowledge. I also cannot thank you enough for getting our NHR for us.

We look forward to continuing our relationship with you

Being from the USA and totally ignorant of the requirements and processes to gain a visa and then permanent residency in Portugal, I have and will continue to rely on Fresh and its outstanding associates 100 percent. To say that they are knowledgeable/expert, excellent and timely communicators, and most importantly, caring. . . is the definition of the term, understatement. I have already recommended them to my family and would be honored to recommend them to any and all prospective clients. I used be a relationship manager and also headed a customer service operation for financial service firms. If still in those positions, I would use my experience with Fresh as an example of what relationship management and customer should and needs to be for training and managing. Thank you, Fresh!!! You are indeed the best.

Amanda and Manuella
I couldn’t be more grateful to Amanda and Manuella for the exceptional care and professionalism they’ve shown throughout my Portuguese citizenship process. Their expertise, attention to detail, and constant support have made what could have been a stressful journey feel smooth and reassuring. They’re not only incredibly knowledgeable but also genuinely committed to their clients’ success. I feel truly confident having them by my side, and I wholeheartedly recommend their services to anyone navigating this process.

Wasted my time
I booked an orientation meeting with Fresh Portugal to learn about their services and determine if they would be a good fit for my needs. Although the booking form requested specific tax information, I wasn’t aware that tax-related questions wouldn’t be addressed at all during the meeting. After waiting several weeks and staying up late for the call, I found it frustrating that this limitation wasn’t clearly communicated, and my concerns during the call felt somewhat dismissed. I hope Fresh Portugal will consider making the purpose and boundaries of the orientation call more explicit in the description to avoid confusion for future clients.

**Update based on their response:**

I’d like to clarify a few points to ensure my review accurately reflects my experience.

1. Swearing Mischaracterization: It’s incorrect to say I swore “multiple times.” I used strong language once at the end of the call, directed toward the website, not the individual. I apologized afterward because I regretted my tone, but I want to set the record straight on the frequency and intent.

2. Expectation for Service Overview, Not Tax Advice: I did not expect free tax advice, nor was this ever my complaint. As my emails stated, I wanted an overview of your tax services to understand the scope of support available. I was informed at the start of the call that the meeting would only cover immigration services. This mismatch between expectations set on the booking page and the actual call content was my primary issue. When I tried to raise this on the call and over emails, my criticisms were dismissed which is what led to losing my temper.

3. Offer to Remove Review: As further evidence that I wasn’t seeking free advice, I declined an offer from your company to receive complimentary tax advice in exchange for removing my review.

4. Clarification on Initial Contact and Paid Services: After attending one free webinar, I reached out to inquire if Fresh Portugal could assist with my situation, specifically regarding NHR eligibility. Initially, I sought confirmation before booking, and I was told via email, “You are right. Being sure that you do not qualify, I see no need for our meeting.” Following this, I met with other tax professionals over the next few months, but they didn’t meet my needs. I eventually decided to book an orientation meeting with Fresh Portugal to fully confirm whether or not your team could assist me, as I genuinely hoped for clarity on your services.

For transparency, I have screenshots of these conversations available upon request.

Thank you for acknowledging my feedback, and I appreciate any updates you make to clarify the orientation meeting description to help future clients set clear expectations.

Dear Ms. Beltran,

Thank you for taking the time to review our service.

When things go wrong, I always reach out to understand what happened so thank you for interacting with me on this matter and also for changing your review to better reflect your experience, as well as to share some suggestions with me on how we may improve the description of the orientation meeting. We are considering your suggestions.

Finally, thank you for reaching out to the lawyer whom you talked to, to apologise for swearing multiple times in the conversation with her. She did not deserve this attitude and an apology goes a long way.

That all said, and with all due respect, I don't think that your review is fair or accurate for the following reasons:

(1) The booking page of the orientation meeting includes the following language:

"These meetings are meant to: Identify relevant issues. Identify the best professional to deal with them...

Before you book an orientation meeting, please read this:

Orientation meetings are not consultation meetings. Consultation is a paid service by the firm... If you already know for example that you want tax advice, there is really no point in booking an orientation meeting."

I believe that this is very clear, though we will indeed try to make it even more clear. You confirmed to me that you read this text but your main complaint remains that the meeting did not include tax advice. In the meeting itself, you made it clear that you are frustrated that you are not receiving (free) tax advice.

(2) You attended one of our free webinars. After the webinar, you reached out to me and to one of my colleagues who is a tax lawyer. We answered some of your questions and suggested that you book a consultation to discuss the others. This was before you booked the free orientation meeting, so it wasn't just the text in the website - we told you explicitly who could help you.

(3) It was unclear from your original review and isn't entirely clear now that you haven't in fact hired any service from FRESH Portugal, nor did you pay us anything. I accept that "interaction" is sufficient under TrustPilot rules to leave a review, but it would have been prudent to clarify that you are not in fact reviewing any actual service by our firm. All you did with us is explore our services.

(4) Ultimately, you attended a webinar, interacted with 3 lawyers in our firm and never purchased any service from us. All routes led to the same outcome which is explaining to you that tax advice is something we charge for (unlike the free webinars). I do understand that this frustrates you, but I believe that it's our prerogative to charge for our services and it's not fair to "punish" us with a bad review simply because we refuse to give you for free something that other clients are paying for.

Again, thank you for sharing your experience with us and we will see how we can improve the relevant page that you complained about and make it even more clear than "if you need tax advice, don't book this service". I can only hope that your journey in Portugal or elsewhere will have nothing but the best experiences.

5 star experience
Hello everyone. I want to give the strongest of recommendations to our real estate lawyer, Daniel Russo from Fresh Portugal. My wife and I began the process of purchasing a property in Praia Da Luz in early August. From the very beginning, with our first zoom meeting with him, to our successful closing yesterday(which we participated in via WhatsApp here in Connecticut), Daniel helped and supported us throughout this process. We could not have done this without him. He met me at this condo in late August for my first walk through, offering suggestions and advice, promptly answering our emails and phone calls, providing us with constant updates, recommended a wonderful bank-Eurobic/Abanca and their very supportive representative Marco Cruz and a terrific currency transfer service, Currency4You and their rep Prem Raja who made the process of transferring large sums of money much less terrifying.
Additionally, Daniel’s practical(and emotional) support throughout this process did not, by any stretch of the imagination, prove to be at all exorbitant. If you’re living overseas and looking to make a purchase in Portugal for investment and possible relocation purposes(as we are), we literally could not heap more praise on Daniel and the folks at Fresh Portugal.

Amanda and the team went above and beyond for us. Not only did they help us when we got the impossible-to-get AIMA appointment, but when my residents card went to an office three hours away, Amanda herself went to pick it up for me. I’m so grateful for their support and knowledge in a system that I’ve found baffling!

The BEST company
The BEST company! I highly recommend Fresh Portugal for your Tax purposes. Originally we went with another company and they calculated that we owe a lot of money to IRS, they didn’t include our NHR status and partial residency year and they didn’t want to change it after I told about this error. I felt it was wrong, so I emailed Fresh Portugal and so glad I did. We worked with Raquel and she’s been amazing! Excellent communication, even after hours and on weekends! Raquel looked throughout the tax return that first company did and noticed numerous mistakes. After everything was corrected, she submitted tax return forms to IRS. Going with Fresh Portugal saved us over 14000 euros in taxes! Thank you , Raquel and Fresh Portugal!

Couldn't Have Done It Without Fresh Portugal
We hired Fresh Portugal to assist with our visa application and can’t say enough wonderful things about the team that was assigned to us. We would like to thank Manuella Sena, Rafaella Gattas, and a special thank you to Amanda Schultz, and Gabriel.
We hired Fresh Portugal several months after we applied for our D7 visa in Washington DC because we could not get an update on the status of our visa after repeated emails and phone calls. The Fresh Portugal team immediately began reaching out to VFS and AIMA to help expedite our temporary visa. It was with their assistance that our visa got approved, and we were given a date for our AIMA appointment. We would also like to say how responsive they were to all our questions!
Our AIMA appointments were scheduled in two different areas of Portugal, on the same day, and at the same time. We notified Amanda, and she assured us that we would each have a lawyer with us. The day of our AIMA appointments my husband traveled to his appointment where Amanda was waiting and informed him that the AIMA office was closed due to a local holiday (Yes, AIMA scheduled this appointment). I was already in the city of Braga with my lawyer (Gabriel), when my husband informed me that he and his lawyer would travel to my location to see if the AIMA office would accommodate his appointment with mine. When they arrived (only 8 minutes before my scheduled appointment) Amanda and Gabriel spoke to the woman who would handling my appointment and explained the situation. They convinced her to handle both of our appointments at the same time. Long story short, we do not believe that we would have been successful trying to handle the process without the help of Fresh Portugal. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!

I have confidence in them!
Fresh Portugal is a growing business because of their in depth level of expertise, which has been difficult to find. It's a field where you'd think there would be a plethora of firms available, but I haven't able to find another firm that can give me the same level of confidence. They are a bit stretched at the seams for this reason, but I have still felt like they handled my situation professionally and with their best level of effort. I particularly enjoyed working with Rebecca and Gonçalo. Fresh Portugal's free webinars are really informative as well. I wish I knew about them BEFORE my family and I moved over!

Excellent personal service
Excellent personal service. Thank you for the great service. My case was a little complex with more than one country involved but you made it effortless. Combining the use of the system to entre the data and the follow up video call was the best of both worlds - thank you and see you next year.

Fresh made made my first year of dual filing a breeze
Fresh made made my first year of filing dual Portuguese and US taxes a really easy process. They really came through for me, making a confusing process easy and much less stressful. The accountants were delightful to work with and always answered my questions fast and thoroughly. I found that all instructions were clear and straightforward. It was a very positive experience. I will be working with them again next year!

Amazing service
Fresh Portugal was amazing from start to finish. First contact was through Whatsapp and everything was super clear and transparent. I then talked to more people and their expertise and transparence impressed me. I will definitely contact them again if needs be.

Good coordination between US and PT taxes
I used FRESH for two years now. I like the clear communications in English, efficient and timely. Most important for me is the coordination between US and Portuguese tax.

We searched high and low in Portugal…
We searched high and low in Portugal for a reliable tax attorney. Emails to various companies went unanswered. Until we came across Fresh Portugal. They answers emails, communicate clearly and take care of your taxes in a timely fashion. Not the cheapest option but I actually trust them. And that ends up being very important when you are living in a foreign company and don’t speak the language. I really don’t want to get into a tussle with the Portuguese tax authority.

Excellent, friendly service, with a smile!
Raquel and the Fresh team were a great help to us throughout the entire experience of filing a Portuguese tax return for the first time. They helped us get our NHR’s under the deadline, for which we will be eternally grateful (well at least for the next 10 years). Raquel patiently answered all my questions and addressed all my concerns with friendly courtesy. Her email responses were quick and professional, and she understood our tax situation very well, so could easily clarify all the rules and details that we were not familiar with. I highly recommend Raquel and her team to expats that want their returns done professionally, accurately, and with a smile.

Wonderful Experience
As our first tax return in Portugal was a bit more complicated than I had anticipated, Raquel from Fresh was an absolute blessing. She helped us navigate the process, set up our Financas activity, and submit our returns. She always had a timely response to questions and concern, provided us with available options, and it was so helpful she spoke English as well. Removed all the tax season stress and anxiety. Wonderful experience. Highly recommend.

Excellent Advice, Great Communication and Success!
We heard about Fresh Portugal from Expats Everywhere and a few FB groups. I then read the TrustPilot reviews and decided to work with Fresh Portugal to assist us with Tax and Immigration work.
What an amazing and successful experience, from our first email exchange, Zoom call and many emails. Fresh Portugal was honest from the start telling us there was no guarantee for success but we were confident Fresh Portugal would give us the best opportunity for achieving NHR and a D7 Visa.
Please note, Fresh Portugal will guide, suggest and advise you, however, it was still our responsibility to collect the paperwork, open the bank accounts, make sure we had a valid lease registered with the Tax Authority, etc. Fresh Portugal was then able to what they do best and make sure what we submitted was done correctly and then processed everything in a very timely manner.
Adding Fresh Portugal to our Team is what allowed us to be successful with getting NHR and soon our D7.
Thank you all.

Secured my financial future
Fresh are the reason I have a future to look forward to here in Portugal. I had severe anxiety about being able to afford to live here but Fresh were professional, efficient, personable, and organised extra meetings with me to iron out any issues. They even offered to contact my landlord. They have gone above and beyond to secure me the NHR and I am extremely grateful for their expertise.

Horribly rude and bad customer service
I recently paid to have Fresh Portugal process my Digital Nomad Visa. I was confused as to the online form and procedures and sent a question. I asked for further details as I was a little confused as to the NHR process vs. the visa process. The response was from a recently appointed legal secretary who instead of further clarifiying my question, refunded my money and told me to go elsewhere. I was appalled as this shows such lack of customer service. And although she's only a legal secretary, her lack of patience in dealing with clients will cause Fresh Portugal to lose much business. If Fresh Portugal has hired a person to communicate in such a rude manner to customers, their business will not only lose money but their good reputation.

I have been a successful business owner for over 40 years and being kind and patient to customers is key, especially new ones who don't know the process. Having already paid $1000 and not had any contact from the company except a couple of email exchanges with a rude secretary, I just want to warn anyone who decides to go with this company now they have a newly appointed contact person who has absolutely no business with dealing with new customers or any customers for that matter.

UPDATE: Your response to this review is claiming things false about my experience. I tried to book a meeting and finally was able to with your confusing website but by that time my money was refunded anyway. I needed one question answered and instead of simply answering a question, your representative pointed me to reading instructions on your website...which I have done. My point is, you NEVER treat customers like this. I was happy to book a meeting with your attorneys and finally figured it out. I build websites for a living so it's not my fault that your website is confusing and asks clients to pay an additional $1000 to book a meeting...which is not only confusing to me but I'm sure many future customers.
I've had the opposite response with Bordr.io. They have been extraordinarily helpful and responsive. At no time did they turn me away because I had a question I needed clarification on.
I hire companies like yours to assist me in a process I know nothing about. I invested $1000 to get personal service for you to help me. Sometimes it's confusing for people who are reading processes they are very unfamiliar with and need some personal interaction to clarify some things in the process. The quick and impulsive response of rudeness to my wanting some clarification was appalling and surprising. I certainly don't want to work with a company that gets frustrated when a question is asked and lashes out the way your representative did. As a business owner myself, customers ask many questions that can be answered easily on my website...but I'm never rude to them. I answer them kindly with patience anyway. That's what a good company with good customer service does...especially a new customer who has already paid $1000 for your services and never had interaction with you before.

Learning you are the owner of the firm makes things even worse. I expected rude behavior from a legal secretary but certainly not the owner. Just because you might be good at law, doesn't mean you have good customer service skills...that is something you certainly need training on. Do better.

Dear Sonserae,

Thank you for sharing your short experience with us and I'm sorry that it has been so negative for you. We take reviews (positive and negative) as an opportunity to learn and improve.

In our practice, it is of paramount importance that clients fully understand the nature of our service, as well as its limitations. You booked an immigration service that is designed to also obtain a tax benefit. This is a complex proposition with an element of risk so it is critical that you understood this risk. Your questions indicated that you did not read that description on our website and I therefore invited you to book a meeting, without additional payment, so that we can explain it in person. You then insisted to not book a meeting and I needed to repeatedly reassure you that there is no additional fee for it.

For this reason, we went ahead and cancelled your package and initiated a full refund. Our intention was to protect you from purchasing a service that you do not understand. It was not to offend you and we are terribly sorry that you seem to have been offended.

As a business, we are happy to have clients, but if we feel that our clients are unable to understand the service and are unwilling to engage with our explanations, we prefer to not have them as clients than to have clients who do not have a full understanding of our services. The later is a recipe for frustration and we wanted to avoid this.

Finally, I don't know why you assumed that you are engaging with a legal secretary. You were in fact engaging with the owner of the firm. This is yet another thing that is entirely clear from our website. I also don't know (and frankly, a bit saddened) that you thought that you are engaging with a woman. I hope we will get past the days when this is an assumption. There is a single thing I regret - when you addressed me as a legal secretary, I found it mildly amusing and therefore replied "just appointed legal secretary", assuming you will look at the website and realise that you were engaging with the owner of the firm. You obviously took my words literally which led to you lashing out in your review at an imaginary newly appointed offensive legal secretary. For this I do apologise - I am British and sometimes irony gets lost between cultures. Clearly it wasn't funny.

As I said before, I'm really sorry that you were offended and assure you that we had and have nothing but your best interest in mind. As I said before, it is very important to engage with service providers who understand you well and I hope that you will find one that suits you.

NHR Saviors!
The team at Fresh Portugal helped us to navigate the process to receive our NHR status before the changes to the law take place at the end of this year. The team were all professional, kind, efficient, fast, and made communication easy for a couple who speaks no Portuguese. We were pleasantly surprised by how quickly they were able to steer us through the process and they made it as painless as humanely possible. I would highly recommend them to anyone needing support with the tax system in Portugal. We will definitely continue to work with them. Thank you Fresh Team!

Professional & Knowledgeable
Zeev and his staff are professional, responsive, knowledgeable and provide a great sense of peace of mind. We were interested in their accelerated tax residency program and attended their informative webinar. We have since pivoted on our approach to immigrating to Portugal. Despite this change in our approach, as promised, our deposit to have our situation analyzed and evaluated was promptly refunded. We look forward to working with this team as our plans move forward.

Brilliant, dedicated, go the extra mile. Highly recommend.
Fresh Portugal provides brilliant and deeply analytical tax services. Having lived in several countries with tax advisors in each country, I can tell you that they are world class, far better than most. The nice thing is that Fresh has multiple tax attorneys who consult with each other and provide careful advice based on an in-depth knowledge of Portuguese, UK, EU and US tax laws. The price tag reflects the depth and breadth of their experience. I am grateful for their assistance and highly recommend their service.

I have been engaged with Fresh now for over a year and they have been very helpful in guiding me in the complexities of the Portuguese tax system. They are knowledgeable, friendly, answer emails in a timely manner and are clearly experts in their field. I would have no hesitation in recommending them to a friend.

Fresh Portugal tax filing alternatives (American, NHR)
I frequently hear that Fresh Portugal is overpriced and that it is possible to get a tax lawyer who knows NHR and the PT-US tax treaty for less. Since Fresh has been raising the prices 20% a year they are at 700-800 EUR with VAT for basic filing. Their FB marketing is good (and a slightly sneaky funnel with the name not clearly being a commercial venture) so I expect the price to be right for them and expats that buy into it.

I expected there to be other options with similar expertise and lesser marketing with a lower price point. Well, I approached 8 tax lawyers last year, including some that were recommended in tax groups. 4 got back to me after a video call with a quote that was 2000 - 4000 for basic filing services, and other planning packages that were 5-10K. This seems crazy and doesn't match at at what I've been hearing.

Anyway last year I went with Fresh and they did file my taxes alright, but they did one questionable thing that didn't match the advice on their forum and made one mistake that I needed to correct. When I asked them about the questionable things, they said this isn't a tax consulting session but I could pay for that if I wanted.

So, is there anyone with NHR + US-PT treaty knowledge that I can expect a better price from for next year? I understand that accountants will be lower priced, but the consensus seems to be they won't understand the NHR nuances.

The whole tax filing in Portugal is pretty much predatory towards expats. It cost more to file in Portugal than it does in the US. That tells you everything you need to know. It’s a real shame.

Oh, that group being an actual hidden business page with that smug jerk Zeev running it just ensured I'd never use Fresh Portugal (also, stupid name but whatever).

We have a complicated tax situation in the US, use our regular CPA there, and since we just got the NHR, used Baker Tilly in PT, which was 750€ for each of us. There is a ton we would have gotten wrong trying to file in PT on our own for 2023. 2024 will be somewhat complicated as well (hoping to divest a US rental property), so we will use Baker Tilly again this year, ideally for the last time, and then be able to.self file.

Those are complete ripoffs.

You can use DMA (https://dmatax.pt/) instead. They charge around 300-400 Euros and answer your questions. I find this amount expensive, too, considering the simplicity of the task, apart from the fact that it is in Portuguese. I think the fair charge would be around 100-200. So that's why I am considering doing it all by myself next year.

Self-employed NHR is very simple to file. You better learn it if you plan to stay in Portugal; over the years, you will save loads of money not paid to expensive tax consultants.

i'd rate Fresh a B+ on their PT prep (dinged for speed, price ... but no mistakes) and an extreme F------ on their US prep services. also interested in affordable alternatives (3 figures $ ok, 4 figures not so much)

If your tax situation is not complex and fairly straight forward, i.e., a single source of income, I would file US taxes using TurboTax, educate yourself on the NHR tax regime for your particular income source, and file PT taxes directly in the portal das finanças. There are resources online, including FB groups that are very helpful and can guide you.

After learning the process last year, I find filing in Portugal is trivial once income classification is done. Of course classification can be hard and that is where a good tax lawyer can help, but most people have income from sources that are common to most expats, so 800EUR for "common income" tax filing sounds too much.
