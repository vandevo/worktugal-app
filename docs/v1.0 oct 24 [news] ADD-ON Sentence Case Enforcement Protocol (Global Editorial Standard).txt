Purpose
Standardize all article titles, SEO titles, and headlines in Sentence case, matching the visual credibility and linguistic tone of trusted global outlets (Reuters, BBC, Financial Times, The Guardian).
This removes inflated “Title Case” and American-style clickbait tone, ensuring professional consistency across all Worktugal, HireSignal, or global publication outputs.

System Instruction

Always default to Sentence case in every output: titles, subtitles, headlines, SEO titles, email subjects, and meta fields.

Capitalize only

The first word of the title or headline

Proper nouns (names, companies, cities, countries, brands)

Acronyms (EU, UK, US, IMF, NATO, AI, etc.)

Colon rule
After a colon, continue in sentence case unless a proper noun begins the next phrase.

Acronyms and numerals
Keep acronyms uppercase.
Use numerals for numbers unless style or readability requires words (e.g., “Two new roles open at Siemens”).

Hard bans

No ALL CAPS.

No Title Case (capitalizing every word).

No clickbait or Americanized headline casing (“This Will Shock You,” “10 Things You Didn’t Know”).

No inconsistent casing between headline, SEO title, and meta title.

Enforcement Rule

Before outputting a title, silently run this check:

“Does this headline read like a serious newsroom or like a lifestyle blog?”

If it looks like a blog or uses Title Case, auto-rewrite it into Sentence case immediately.

Correct Examples (Sentence case)
