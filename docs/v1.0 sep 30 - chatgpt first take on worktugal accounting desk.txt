Got you. Here’s a sharp, no-fluff plan to pick the right wedge, launch fast in 4 days, and make it pay.

Where the money really is

Accountants win as the first wedge. Demand is constant and urgent: NIF questions, freelancer setup, quarterly VAT, IRS returns, NISS, receipts, fines, audits. Premium tax lawyers are pricey and booked; they’re great for complex cases later, not for day-one scale. Example signals: Fresh Portugal charges €420 for a 30-min consult and ~€3,500 for a personal tax plan, targeting higher-income clients . Mass NIF players are crowded and cheap; some charge €79–€150 for NIF with fiscal rep upsells and bank account add-ons, so margins are thin and churny . General relocation bundles (D7/D8) are common and price-anchored at €899–€1,199, but require heavy ops and broad scope .

Your best opening: an “Accounting Desk for Expats” that guarantees a paid, on-time consult and a concrete deliverable. You control the checkout. Providers just show up. No chasing anyone.

The wedge

Worktugal Accounting Desk. Portugal-only. English-first. Freelancers, remote workers, early movers.

Unique advantages

Instant-book, prepaid consults that start on time.

Clear deliverables per package.

A simple “case tracker” that shows status and next steps, reducing anxiety. Think Lawfully’s timelines and notifications concept adapted to Portugal tax and admin flows .

Core paid offers to launch

30-minute tax triage. €59. Within 48h. We keep 25 percent. Provider gets a calendar slot, shows up, gets paid.

Freelancer start pack. €299–€399. Open atividade, VAT if needed, e-Factura access, NISS guidance, first “recibos verdes” walkthrough. We keep ~20 percent. This is the high-intent, high-pain entry.

Annual return pack. Start at €800 in the market for expats; target a mid-range partner catalog and take 10–15 percent .

Add-ons. VAT registration €120, quarterly filing €99 each, NIF rep transfer €79, address update €79, lease review €150 with partner lawyer if needed .

Why this converts

Fresh’s pricing signals willingness to pay for clarity and speed at the high end .

Mid-market accountants already sell advisory from €280, filings from €275, freelancer setup from €300, proving demand and price acceptance .

NIF mills are cheap but impersonal; your edge is live help plus a tracker and guaranteed outcome windows .

How it works operationally

Flow

User books and pays on Worktugal. You are merchant of record. Slots are real. Instant email and WhatsApp confirmation.

Intake form collects exact income sources and residency facts. You pre-score the case and attach a checklist.

Provider receives a structured brief and joins a calendar event with a Worktugal notepad template.

Payouts happen after the session concludes. No-show policy: prepay with reschedule once.

Provider side

Pitch: “zero billing admin, prepaid show-up work, reliable pipeline.” GoalSeek-style services confirm the scope accountants already offer; you bundle and productize them .

Start with boutique accountants comfortable in English. Offer a “found money” channel with clear SLA.

Legal and trust

Prominent disclaimer: Worktugal is not a law firm or accountant; services are delivered by accredited pros. This is standard across competitors .

GDPR: encrypted file upload, minimum data retention, clear DPA with providers.

Receipts with VAT breakdown. Written scope and refund rules in plain English.

MVP, built fast, Bolt-ready

Scope only what Bolt.new can ship cleanly without custom stacks. You asked to trust Bolt; so we keep features “Claude-buildable” from day one.

Essential screens

Landing with three offers and trust signals.

Booking flow with time slots, Stripe checkout, and confirmation.

Intake form with dynamic questions by case type.

Case tracker showing step, owner, ETA, and documents required. Inspired by Lawfully’s clear status updates and projected timelines .

Provider portal lite: calendar, briefs, payout ledger.

Data model

Users, Providers, Bookings, Packages, Checklists, Documents, Payouts, Notes.

Status machine: requested, paid, scheduled, in-session, delivered, revision, closed, refunded.

SLAs

Triage call within 48h.

Start pack kickoff within 3 business days.

Return draft within 10 business days after document completeness.

Pricing and unit economics

Example month one

40 triage calls at €59: €2,360 gross. Keep 25 percent = €590.

15 start packs at €349 avg: €5,235 gross. Keep 20 percent = €1,047.

5 annual returns at €800: €4,000 gross. Keep 12.5 percent = €500.

Total platform margin ≈ €2,137 before payment fees and ads.

Ads: start with content and partnerships; keep CAC near zero for the pilot.

Audience and acquisition

Where to pull demand

Worktugal’s own channels and DMs.

Expat FB groups, Reddit threads, niche Discords.

Content: “Do you really need IVA?” “First 90 days in Portugal, tax edition.” “Receipts verdes in 10 screenshots.”

Direct partner feeds: relocation services that stop at NIF and bank account can pass you tax clients; many already productize these flows at transparent price points you can match or beat .

Four-day launch plan

Day 1

Pick final offer names, prices, refunds.

Draft all copy. Build a one-page landing with three CTAs.

Create the intake forms and the consult notepad template.

Day 2

Wire Stripe and payout settings. Set no-show and refund logic.

Seed supplier calendar with three accountants and five daily slots. Offer them guaranteed paid trials.

Day 3

Ship tracker v0: five status steps, manual updates only.

Dry-run three internal bookings with friends to test end-to-end.

Day 4

Go live to Worktugal audience, two FB groups, one Reddit thread.

Offer five “founder slots” with same-day triage and a €20 voucher toward a start pack.

What not to build yet

Full visa concierge and property services. Heavy ops, lower margins, wider scope. Others already package it tightly at €899–€1,199 with legal chats and case managers .

A NIF-only funnel race to the bottom. Competitors sell €79–€150 with fiscal rep upsells; value capture is thin and customer LTV is weak .

Risks and counters

Supply quality varies. Counter with trial jobs, recorded calls (with consent), CSAT surveys, and right to replace provider.

Scope creep in start packs. Counter with a numbered checklist and out-of-scope upsells.

Cash flow timing. Hold payouts 48h post-session. Clear refund policy for no-deliverable cases.

Decision, crisp

Start with accountants. Launch the Accounting Desk now. Add a light lawyer consult later as an upsell path once the engine runs.

If you want, I’ll draft the Bolt-ready prompt pack for the MVP screens, schema, and flows in one go.
