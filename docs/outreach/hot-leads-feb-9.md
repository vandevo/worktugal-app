**Issues:** No activity opened, >€15k VAT threshold, No NISS.
**Subject:** Urgent: Your Worktugal Tax Checkup Results (Action Required)

Hi Umar,

I just reviewed your Tax Checkup results for Worktugal. You have 3 critical red flags that need immediate attention, specifically regarding your VAT status and unregistered economic activity.

Because you’ve already exceeded the €15,000 threshold without registering, you are likely liable for retroactive VAT and potential fines. We offer a **Detailed Compliance Review (€49)** where we use AI research and human verification to map out exactly how to fix this before you get flagged by the AT.

Are you available for a quick chat about getting this sorted?

Best,
Van

**Issues:** No activity opened, >€15k VAT threshold.
**Subject:** Heads up on your VAT threshold (Worktugal Checkup)

Hi Chris,

Thanks for running the Worktugal checkup. I noticed you're earning over €15k but haven't opened your activity or registered for VAT yet. In Portugal, this is a "Day 1" priority because the fines for undeclared activity start at €500.

I’d recommend our **Detailed Compliance Review**. We can verify your specific CAE (activity codes) and prepare a readiness report you can hand straight to an accountant to fix this in one go.

Would you like the link to start the formal review?

Best,
Van

## 3. Ali Husnain (ch4424340@gmail.com)
**Issues:** Missing NIF (6+ months resident), Missing NISS.
**Subject:** Critical NIF/NISS Status - Worktugal Checkup

Hi Ali,

I’m reaching out because your Worktugal results show you’ve been in Portugal for over 6 months without a NIF or NISS registration. This is a high-risk situation for your residency status.

We can help you verify exactly what’s missing and what the penalties might be. Our €49 review provides a full roadmap for your compliance.

Let me know if you want to proceed.

Best,
Van

**Issues:** Missing NIF (6+ months resident), Missing NISS.
**Subject:** Compliance Gap: NIF & NISS Registration

Hi Shannon,

Reviewing your results from the Worktugal checkup. Since you're a resident but missing both NIF and NISS, you're currently in a compliance "blind spot" that could affect your residency renewal.

Our **Detailed Compliance Review** is designed for exactly this. We provide a human-verified report on your readiness to engage with an accountant.

Would you like to see a sample of what the review covers?

Best,
Van

## 5. Andel Frazier (andel.frazier@gmail.com)
**Issues:** VAT threshold exceeded, Missing NISS.
**Subject:** VAT and NISS Warning - Worktugal Checkup

Hi Andel,

Your recent checkup flagged 3 critical issues, primarily centered around your VAT liability. Exceeding the €15k threshold without registration is one of the most common reasons for heavy fines in Portugal.

I'd like to help you get this resolved. Our €49 review will give you the exact steps to bring your situation into compliance.

Interested in the next steps?

Best,
Van

## 6. Rob (robthrownaway@gmail.com)
**Issues:** 4 Red Flags (Activity, VAT, NISS).
**Subject:** Urgent: Multiple Compliance Risks (Worktugal)

Hi Rob,

I just saw your checkup results—you have 4 red flags, which is significantly higher than the average freelancer we see. Between the missing activity registration and the VAT threshold, you are at high risk for an audit or significant fines.

I highly recommend our **Detailed Compliance Review**. We'll do the deep research on your specific situation and give you a verified path to fix all 4 issues.

Can we help you get this under control?

Best,
Van

## 7. Juned Ahmed (laeykahmad@gmail.com)
**Issues:** Missing NIF, Missing NISS.
**Subject:** Your Compliance Score (Worktugal)

Hi Juned,

Thanks for using the Worktugal checkup. You're currently at 25% compliance due to the missing NIF and NISS. As a resident, these are mandatory for almost any legal process in Portugal.

We can provide a detailed roadmap to get you to 100% via our €49 review.

Ready to close those gaps?

Best,
Van
