## 1. Initial WhatsApp Touch (Short & Direct)

"Hi [Name], this is Van from Worktugal.

I received your application to partner with us as an accountant. I'm looking for our first 'Operator Zero'—a partner who can help us verify compliance reports for foreign freelancers and handle the high-intent leads we generate.

Do you have 10 minutes for a quick WhatsApp call today or tomorrow to discuss how this works?

Best,
Van"

## 2. Follow-up / Value Prop

"The goal is simple: We use AI to do 90% of the intake and research, and you provide the final 'stamp of readiness' for a fee, plus you get the client for the actual filing/opening if you want them. No more messy emails or missing documents—we handle the gatekeeping."

## 3. Triage Role Definition

- **Verification**: You review the €49 AI-drafted report (10-15 mins max).
- **Handoff**: If the client is ready, you take them into your practice.
- **Feedback**: You tell us if our AI missed any regulatory nuances.
