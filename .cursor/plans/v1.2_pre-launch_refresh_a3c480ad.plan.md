# v1.2 Pre-Launch Page Refresh (Readyfile Reorientation)

## What I Found (Current Problems)

1. **Free checkup results have NO upsell to paid review.** The "What's next?" section has two DISABLED "Coming Soon" buttons. The paid compliance review IS live at /compliance-review but the free funnel does not point to it. This is the single biggest conversion leak.
2. **Homepage says "Updated for 2025"** and only pushes the free checkup. No mention of the paid review anywhere. Outdated bolt.new era copy.
3. **Compliance review landing page** has decent structure but copy could be stronger. Legal disclaimers exist but should be more prominent and consistent.
4. **Success page after paid review** says "We review your responses manually" -- this is now partially automated with Parallel.ai. Also does not mention the AI-assisted research.
5. **Case reference is already tracked** in Supabase (`paid_compliance_reviews.id`). The success page already shows the first 8 chars. No additional DB work needed.

## The 3-Layer OS Strategy (Readyfile Focus)

Based on the **Behavioral Systems Compiler (Layer 1-3)**, we are shifting from "Selling a Review" to "Enforcing Readiness".

### PHASE 1: Pre-Launch Refresh & Dual-AI (Status: ACTIVE)

**Goal:** Fix the funnel and implement the "Best of Both Worlds" AI research.

- **Institutional Accuracy**: Parallel.ai fetches the laws (Layer 1: Effort minimization).
- **Human Empathy**: Perplexity (Sonar) writes the report in the user's voice (Layer 2: Prudence).
- **Conversion**: Active CTA banners and dual-path Hero sections.

### PHASE 2: The Readyfile Artifact (The "Source of Truth")

**Goal:** Transform the review into a tangible, shareable file that professionals respect.

- **File Generation**: Create the logic to turn Research + User Data into a downloadable "Readyfile" PDF.
- **Social Signaling**: The file acts as a "Clearance" badge for the user (Layer 3: Status).
- **Effort Removal**: The user no longer "explains" their case; they just "send the file."

### PHASE 3: The Expert Marketplace (Monetization & Scale)

**Goal:** The final handoff to vetted accountants/lawyers.

- **Find-a-Consultant**: Implement the UI designed in **Stitch** (`resources/design/consultant-match-ui.png`).
- **Direct Booking**: Use **Cal.com** integration to allow instant strategy call bookings.
- **Market Disruption**: We don't sell accountants; we sell the **Readyfile**, and then give the user the fastest way to use it with an expert.

## UI Design Artifacts

## Priority Tiers (Phase 1)

### PRIORITY 1: Ship Before First Email (compliance-review landing + checkup upsell)

- Fix Checkup Results Upsell (Critical)
- Refresh Compliance Review Landing Page Copy

### PRIORITY 2: Ship Before Second Campaign (homepage + results refinement)

- Homepage Refresh

### PRIORITY 3: Ship After First Sales (polish and future-proofing)

- Success Page Update
- Legal Disclaimers Standardization
- Readyfile Language Seeding
