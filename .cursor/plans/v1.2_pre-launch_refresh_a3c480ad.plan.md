# v1.2 Pre-Launch Page Refresh

## What I Found (Current Problems)

1. **Free checkup results have NO upsell to paid review.** The "What's next?" section has two DISABLED "Coming Soon" buttons. The paid compliance review IS live at /compliance-review but the free funnel does not point to it. This is the single biggest conversion leak.
2. **Homepage says "Updated for 2025"** and only pushes the free checkup. No mention of the paid review anywhere. Outdated bolt.new era copy.
3. **Compliance review landing page** has decent structure but copy could be stronger. Legal disclaimers exist but should be more prominent and consistent.
4. **Success page after paid review** says "We review your responses manually" -- this is now partially automated with Parallel.ai. Also does not mention the AI-assisted research.
5. **Case reference is already tracked** in Supabase (`paid_compliance_reviews.id`). The success page already shows the first 8 chars. No additional DB work needed.

## Answers to Your Questions

**Dashboard vs one-time PDF?**
For now: one-time report. You review the AI draft, finalize it, and send the PDF via email. No user dashboard needed yet. That is Phase 3. Keep it simple -- you are a solo founder, do not build a dashboard before proving 5+ paid reviews work smoothly.

**Can users regenerate?**
No. They pay once, fill the form once, receive one report. If their situation changes significantly, they can purchase again. Keep it simple for v1.

**Monthly legislation updates?**
This is Phase 2 of the Parallel.ai plan. Not urgent until after you have 5+ paying customers. For now, the Parallel.ai Search API researches fresh sources per review. The hardcoded rules in `taxCheckupEnhancements.ts` were last updated Jan 1, 2026 and are current enough for now.

**Legal safety?**
Every user-facing page must include: "This is not legal or tax advice. Information is educational only. Verify with a licensed professional." This protects you. You are a risk identification layer, not an advisor. We will add this consistently.

## Priority Tiers

### PRIORITY 1: Ship Before First Email (compliance-review landing + checkup upsell)

These two changes directly affect conversion from your email campaign.

#### 1A. Fix Checkup Results Upsell (Critical)

**File:** [src/components/accounting/CheckupResults.tsx](src/components/accounting/CheckupResults.tsx)

**Problem:** The "What's next?" section has two disabled "Coming Soon" buttons that do not link to `/compliance-review`. The paid product is LIVE but the free funnel is broken.

**Fix:**

- Replace the disabled "Complete your compliance profile" button with an active CTA: "Get Your Detailed Compliance Review" linking to `/compliance-review`
- Copy: "Your free checkup identified [X] issues. Get a detailed human-reviewed analysis with escalation flags, official source citations, and a prioritized action plan. One-time payment, no subscription."
- Price anchor: Show "49 EUR" clearly
- Remove the "Coming Soon" labels entirely
- Keep the second option (Specialist consultations) as "Coming Soon" or remove it
- Add urgency: "Your results are saved. A detailed review will reference your checkup data."

#### 1B. Refresh Compliance Review Landing Page Copy

**File:** [src/components/accounting/PaidReviewLanding.tsx](src/components/accounting/PaidReviewLanding.tsx)

**Changes:**

- Update headline from "Detailed Compliance Risk Review" toward clearer risk-prevention framing: "Know Where You Stand Before Portugal Fines You"
- Strengthen the value proposition -- emphasize what users AVOID (fines, penalties, blocked permits) not just what they GET
- Add the AI-assisted research angle: "Your intake is cross-referenced against current Portuguese regulations from official sources" (without saying "AI writes your report")
- Make the disclaimer more prominent but calm: standard footer on every section
- Update "Human-reviewed analysis" to "AI-assisted research, human-verified report" (honest, trust-building)
- Add social proof if possible: "Based on analysis of 90+ freelancer compliance situations"
- Ensure mobile-friendly layout (this is where email links land)

### PRIORITY 2: Ship Before Second Campaign (homepage + results refinement)

#### 2A. Homepage Refresh

**File:** [src/components/HomePage.tsx](src/components/HomePage.tsx) and related CheckupHero, CheckupHowItWorks, etc.

**Changes:**

- Update "Updated for 2025" to "Updated for 2026"
- Add a secondary CTA path to the paid compliance review (not just the free checkup)
- Structure: Free checkup as entry point, paid review as the premium option
- Consider a split hero: "Free Checkup (3 min)" | "Detailed Review (49 EUR)" side by side
- Update testimonial dates if needed
- Refresh the "Why this matters" section with current penalty amounts and 2026 rules
- Add Readyfile-adjacent language without fully rebranding yet: "compliance readiness" instead of "compliance review"

#### 2B. Refine Checkup Results Page

**File:** [src/components/accounting/CheckupResults.tsx](src/components/accounting/CheckupResults.tsx)

**Additional changes beyond 1A:**

- Improve the report display with better formatting
- Make red flags more visually urgent
- Add a persistent banner/CTA for the paid review that stays visible as user scrolls
- Update the feedback section text
- Remove "first version" language ("This is our first version and we're continuously improving")

### PRIORITY 3: Ship After First Sales (polish and future-proofing)

#### 3A. Success Page Update

**File:** [src/components/accounting/PaidReviewSuccess.tsx](src/components/accounting/PaidReviewSuccess.tsx)

- Update "We review your responses manually" to reflect AI-assisted workflow: "Your intake is being cross-referenced against current Portuguese regulations. A human reviewer will verify and finalize your report."
- Add the status timeline: Submitted → Researching → Under Review → Delivered
- Keep "Within 48 hours" SLA

#### 3B. Legal Disclaimers Standardization

**All user-facing pages:**

- Create a shared `ComplianceDisclaimer` component used across all pages
- Standard text: "Worktugal provides compliance readiness assessment and educational information only. This is not legal or tax advice. Information is sourced from official Portuguese authorities where available. Final decisions should be confirmed with a licensed professional (OCC-certified accountant or lawyer)."
- Footer-level disclaimer on every page

#### 3C. Readyfile Language Seeding

- Begin using "compliance readiness" language instead of "compliance review" in new copy
- Do NOT rename the product or change URLs yet
- This seeds the direction for the Readyfile reframe (separate plan v1.0)

## What This Does NOT Include (Explicitly Deferred)

- User dashboard (Phase 3)
- PDF generation (Phase 3)
- Monthly legislation updates via Parallel.ai (Phase 2)
- Full Readyfile rebranding (separate plan)
- Accountant marketplace features
- New intake form questions

## Relationship to Existing Plans

- **v1.1 Parallel.ai Integration**: Phase 1 complete. This plan builds on it by updating copy to reference AI-assisted research.
- **v1.0 Readyfile Reframe**: Not started. This plan seeds Readyfile language without executing the full reframe.

## Estimated Scope

- Priority 1 (before first email): 2 files, ~200 lines of copy changes
- Priority 2 (before second campaign): 2-4 files, ~300 lines of copy changes  
- Priority 3 (after first sales): 3-4 files, ~150 lines of copy + new shared component
