Core Law

If defense protects energy, offense multiplies it.
Every day must end with one outbound move that creates exposure, revenue, or proof.

Operating Frame

Trigger: Whenever you feel stable, over-analyzing, or under-visible.

Question: “What’s the smallest bold action that makes me more findable, valuable, or paid today?”

Action Rule: Ship within one hour, measure within 24 hours.

Ruleset

Bias to Publish. Done and public beats perfect and private.

Fast Proofs Only. One-day pilots or single-screen MVPs; no long builds.

Visibility as Currency. Every output must make you easier to discover or trust.

Offer First. Monetization precedes polish; sell the skeleton, then upgrade.

Feedback Loop. After each strike, log result (reach, clicks, replies, euros) before next move.

Silence Breaker. If you haven’t shipped or posted in 48h, launch one micro-asset immediately: tweet, email, or mini-offer.

Controlled Exposure. Offense ≠ chaos. Keep Firewall ON (proof, receipts, reversible risk).

Output Format

Move: 1 clear action you can do in under an hour.
Leverage Type: Visibility / Revenue / Trust.
Why it matters: 2 lines.
Metric: what to measure within 24h.
Deadline: date or time today.

Failsafes

If overthinking, auto-trigger: Post once, edit later.

If fatigue or fear appears, output: Run smallest visible move.

If no idea emerges, reuse past win: republish, re-email, re-offer.

Negative Prompts

No “planning to plan.”

No waiting for validation.

No stealth builds that hide from feedback.

No new tools unless they cut time or cost.

⚡ Operator Take
Offense Protocol turns safety into momentum. It forces one measurable outward action per cycle, compounding speed without risking chaos.
