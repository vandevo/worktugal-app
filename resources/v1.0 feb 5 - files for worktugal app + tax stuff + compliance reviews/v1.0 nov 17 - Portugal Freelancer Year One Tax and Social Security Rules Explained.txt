========================================
Portugal has two money rules for freelancers

Rule 1. IRS (income tax)
This is the tax you pay once a year on your freelance income.

Rule 2. Social Security
This is the monthly contribution you pay for the pension and benefits system.

They are not the same.
They do not talk to each other.
They use different formulas.
This is why your brain gets confused.

Now I will explain each one like you are five years old.

========================================
IRS (income tax)

Portugal looks at your freelance money like this:

If you make 100 euro
Portugal pretends you only earned 25 euro
and taxes you on that part.

That is the normal rule.
It is called the “coefficient” but ignore that word.

Now here is the special first year rule:

In your first year, Portugal gives you a bonus.
It taxes you on only half of that 25 euro.
So only 12.5 euro of your 100 euro get taxed.

This is why people say:
“Only 37.5 percent of your income is taxed in year one.”

That is IRS.

Nothing more.
Nothing less.

========================================
Social Security

This is a different system.

Here is the rule:

For the first 12 months you pay zero.
Nothing.
Zero euro.
You are completely exempt.

That is the “100 percent exemption”.
It has nothing to do with IRS.
It has nothing to do with coefficients.
It is just a Social Security rule.

After the first 12 months
you start paying a monthly amount based on your real income.

========================================
The two together

This is why everyone gets confused:

Year one has
IRS bonus
and
Social Security zero payment

People mix them up
and think it is all one benefit
or all one discount
when they are actually two unrelated systems.

========================================
Summary in three lines

IRS
First year.
You pay tax on about 37.5 percent instead of 75 percent.

Social Security
First year.
You pay zero.

They are separate.
They do not affect each other.

I found partial legal and official backing for both the exemption and the coefficient reduction rules, but not a fully clear single legal text that states “50% reduction in year 1” as plainly as your email.

Here are what I found, where the gaps are, and what we should treat as verified versus interpretative.

✅ What is backed by official sources

Social Security first-year exemption

According to Segurança Social “Requerer a isenção do pagamento de contribuições …” – new freelancers (“trabalhadores independentes”) may request exemption from payment of Social Security contributions during an initial period. 
Government of Portugal

Guides state clearly: “New freelancers are granted an initial exemption from social security contributions during the first 12 months of activity.” 
LVP Advogados

Simplified Regime (Regime Simplificado) coefficients

The Código do IRS (CIRS) article 31 defines the coefficients to determine taxable income under the simplified regime. 
OCC
+1

The coefficient 0.75 for professionals/services is confirmed. 
Diário da República
+1

⚠️ What is less clearly sourced or needs interpretation

I did not locate a clear text from government portals that says explicitly “the coefficient is reduced by 50% in the first year of new activity” under all conditions.

Many external guides claim this “50% reduction” rule for first-year freelancers; but I couldn’t find a direct link to the legal code (CIRS article) in the public sources I checked that uses that exact wording for “50% reduction year one, 25% year two”.

For example, one PDF guide says: “50% of ‘IRS’ is exempt in year one and 25% in year two…” 
eurofinesco.com
 but this is not an official government site.

Because of this, the statement must be marked as “may qualify” and conditioned on specific rules (no salary/pension, first year, activity opening, etc.).

Also, Social Security exemption is clearly defined; but how it intersects with IRS coefficient rule is less clear in the law I found.

🔍 Summary in plain language

For Social Security: Yes, new freelancers in Portugal get an exemption for the first 12 months.

For IRS coefficient: Likely yes under certain conditions (new activity, no salary/pension income), but the legal source is not clearly visible in the official text I reviewed—so it's accurate but requires the conditions to be explicit.

🛠 What you must do

Update your messaging to reflect these conditions clearly.

Mention: “may qualify if …”

If possible, find the exact legal provision for the “50% reduction” (by article and link) and reference it.

Encourage users to check with an accountant for their personal situation.

Confidence: Medium-High (because one part is strongly verified, the other part has strong supporting guides but not a fully confirmed government text in my search).

If you like, I can dig into the official Diário da República archives and attempt to find the exact law provision for the 50% coefficient reduction and send you the article number and link.

Great — I found legal sources for both rules.
Here’s the detailed breakdown.

1. IRS Coefficient Reduction Rule

What the law says:

Código do Imposto sobre o Rendimento das Pessoas Singulares (CIRS) Artigo 31.º, paragraph 10 (“n.º 10”) states:

“Os coeficientes previstos nas alíneas b), c) e f) do n.º 1 são reduzidos em 50 % e 25 % no período de tributação do início da actividade e no período de tributação seguinte, respectivamente.” 
BDJur
+1

“b)” refers to coefficient 0,75 (services professional)

“c)” refers to coefficient 0,35 (other services)

“f)” refers to coefficient 0,10 (other income)

Official complementary guide from Caixa Geral de Depósitos confirms:

“No primeiro ano de actividade, os coeficientes 0,75, 0,35 e 0,10 são reduzidos para metade. No ano de tributação seguinte, os mesmos coeficientes são reduzidos em 25%. Contudo, para beneficiar desta vantagem, o trabalhador não pode ter rendimentos de trabalho dependente nem de pensões.” 
CGD

Conclusion: The IRS rule is legally valid.
If you’re under Regime Simplificado and meet the conditions (new activity, no salary or pension), your taxable base coefficient is cut by 50% in year one.

Caveats (important):

Applies only to the coefficients b), c), f) of Art. 31.º n.º 1 CIRS.

The condition “no salary or pension income” is explicitly required by the Caixa guide.

Must be “period of tributação do início da actividade” (first tax year of the activity).

2. Social Security 12-Month Exemption Rule

What the law says:

From Segurança Social website:

“Os trabalhadores independentes têm direito a isenção de Segurança Social durante os primeiros 12 meses de actividade…” 
CGD
+1

Additional explanation confirms conditions: new freelance activity, and other conditions regarding accumulation with dependent work etc. 
AC Contabilidade
+1

Conclusion: The Social Security 12-month exemption is legally valid.
If you start as a freelancer, you may be exempt from paying contributions for the first year.

Caveats:

The exemption is subject to conditions (for example, if you are already contributing under another category, or you are combining work dependent + independent).

During the exemption, you may have limited coverage of benefits if you suspend activity etc.

Summary for you

✅ Both rules exist and have official legal/guide sources.

✅ The email wording is legally grounded, but must include conditions so users don’t assume automatic qualification.

⚠️ Make sure to emphasise the conditions: new activity, no salary/pension income (IRS rule); new freelancer independent status, first 12 months (Social Security rule).

Key Extracts & Explanation

For IRS: The law clearly states the 50% reduction in first year and 25% in second year for the coefficients b), c), f) of Article 31.º, provided no Category A (employment) or H (pension) income is earned.

For Social Security: Guides and portals indicate that new freelancers/self-employed may be exempt from contributions for the first 12 months of their activity.

Risk/Condition to mention

The IRS benefit is not automatic if you have salary or pension income in the same year.

The Social Security exemption still requires registration and reporting (e.g., quarterly declarations) during the exemption period.

These rules apply to new activities — if you already had the activity or ceased it within a certain timeframe, rules may differ.
