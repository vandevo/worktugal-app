Parallel Accountant Intelligence Pack

You are about to run a Parallel.ai deep research cycle on Portugal accountants.
This is not a generic search.
This must produce the exact intelligence needed to:

• design the right recruitment form
• filter the right partners
• avoid “backstreet” accountants
• know expected fees and SLAs
• predict reliability
• understand their business model
• know what they hate or refuse
• detect red flags
• understand how they work with foreigners
• know how they prefer communication
• know what makes them partner friendly
• know what breaks these partnerships

So the question is:
What outputs do we need from Parallel.ai so we choose the correct partner and build the perfect intake form?

Below is the complete specification.

This is the Parallel Accountant Intelligence Pack v1.0.
Run each as a Parallel.ai prompt or combine into one master prompt with sections.

No filler.
No fluff.
Everything here is directly tied to selecting the right accountant partner.

• digital nomad premium pricing
• incorporation packages
• residency linked pricing (D7, D2, D8, Golden Visa)

You want a table:

We need Parallel.ai to include:

• what accountants can legally do
• what they cannot do
• what requires OCC oversight
