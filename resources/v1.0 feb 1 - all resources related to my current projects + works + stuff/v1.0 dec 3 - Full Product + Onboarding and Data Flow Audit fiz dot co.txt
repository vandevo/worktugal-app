6. Gaps You Can Exploit (Very Clear)
Gap 1. No pre-compliance risk engine

FIZ assumes freelancer is already legit.
Worktugal can own:

NIF

NISS

Activity status

Regime rules

Residency traps

Visa logic

VAT threshold triggers

Coefficient traps

Social Security category errors

Gap 2. No cross border logic

Worktugal can serve:

Digital nomads

Remote income

Foreign salary

Migration

Mixed residence

“First year” coefficient reduction traps

Gap 3. No tax season intelligence

FIZ has no:

Portugal fiscal clock

Month by month trap avoidance

Calendar with blackout periods

Penalty prediction

Gap 4. No diagnostic → accountant matching

Use outputs like:

“Has crypto income”

“Has US employer”

“Has EU multi country invoice”

“D7 resident”

Then match accountant who passed relevant stress tests.

7. Should you copy FIZ’s steps?
Yes, copy these (generic no-risk primitives)

Profile type

Branding step

Customer creation

Item creation

Invoice builder

SAF-T forwarding

Accountant portal basics

No, do NOT copy these — do better

AT credential request

Too trust heavy

Lack of risk warnings

Lack of onboarding clarity

Lack of multi-language explanation

Lack of pre-diagnostic screening

No behavioral OS

You should add

Risk tags per step

Residency logic

Visa logic

Threshold trackers

Red flags

Monthly timeline

8. Missing Pieces Found in Your Scrape

Here is what I noticed:

Missing 1 – No onboarding for VAT periodicity

VAT monthly vs quarterly is not captured.

Missing 2 – No “open activity” verification

FIZ does NOT check if your activity is actually open at Finanças.

Missing 3 – No CAE validation

FIZ does not see if you picked the correct CAE for services.

Missing 4 – No income source classification

Platforms, foreign employers, crypto, etc.

Missing 5 – No first year reduction check

Portugal’s 50 percent rule for first year is not applied.

Missing 6 – No Social Security escalão warnings
Missing 7 – No alerts for 12th month Social Security jump
Missing 8 – No NHR / tax benefit analysis

FIZ is 100 percent domestic oriented.
