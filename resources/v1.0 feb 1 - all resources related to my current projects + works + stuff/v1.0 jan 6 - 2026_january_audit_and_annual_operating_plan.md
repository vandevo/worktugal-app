# 2026 January Audit and Annual Operating Plan

## Purpose
This document is the single reference point for 2026. It sets the baseline narrative, constraints, and timing rules. It is reviewed monthly. No re interpretation unless facts change.

---

## Personal and Life Baseline

• Location: Lisbon, Portugal
• Legal status: EU Family Member residence, eligible for permanent residence in 2026
• Household: Partner (EU citizen), 1 French bulldog puppy
• Work posture: Digital only, no IRL events, no local networking dependency
• Priority: Nervous system stability, income stability, administrative predictability

Portugal is infrastructure, not identity.

## Immigration and Legal Timeline

### Status
• Current card: Cartão de Residência, Familiar UE Art.º 10 (Directive 2004/38)
• Issue date: 22 Sep 2021
• Expiry: 22 Sep 2026

### 2026 Target
• Apply for Permanent Residence Card for Family Member of EU Citizen
• Authority: AIMA

### Fixed Calendar Blocks
• 01 Mar 2026: First legal sanity review
• 01 Apr–31 May 2026: Document collection window
• 31 May 2026: All documents complete internally
• 01 Jun 2026: Send full pack to lawyer
• 22 Jun–22 Aug 2026: Submission window

Citizenship is deferred until income is stable. No action in 2026.

## Portugal Calendar Operating System

### Hard Dead Zones
• August: Total administrative dead zone
• Mid Dec–Mid Jan: Progressive shutdown

### Soft Slow Zones
• Carnival week (Feb)
• Easter week (Apr)
• Mid June (Lisbon)

### Real Execution Windows
• Mid Feb–Jun
• Sep–Oct

Rule: Any action that depends on Portugal must be scheduled in execution windows only.

---

## Business and Work Posture

• Worktugal: Digital only, asynchronous
• No IRL events, no unpaid calls, no community labor
• All value gated by payment or formal commitment

Focus is on:
• SEO
• Email
• Automated funnels
• Global audience

Portugal based demand is secondary.

---

## Financial and Administrative Hygiene

Monthly checks:
• Finanças status, no unresolved notices
• Segurança Social status
• Address consistency across systems

Income level does not matter. Clean status does.

---

## Relationship and Continuity Safeguards

• Maintain clear paper trail of relationship basis
• Avoid long undocumented absences from Portugal
• Keep address proofs lightly refreshed

No over documentation. Only coherence.

---

## 2026 Monthly Review Checklist

At the start of each month, answer only these:

1. Is income stable or improving?
2. Did I accidentally start anything in a Portugal dead zone?
3. Is my administrative status still clean?
4. Did I respect digital only boundaries?
5. Is anything immigration related required this month?

If all are clear, no action.

---

## 2026 Mental Rules

• Rights first, privileges later
• Timing beats effort
• No urgency without leverage
• If it affects income, residence continuity, or nervous system stability, act
• Otherwise, ignore

---

## Annual Anchor Sentence

“2026 is for stability, digital leverage, and securing permanent residence. Everything else is optional.”
