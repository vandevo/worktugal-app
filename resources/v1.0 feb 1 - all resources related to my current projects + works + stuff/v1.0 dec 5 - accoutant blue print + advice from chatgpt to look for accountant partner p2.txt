Here is the accountant profile your own files demand.
This is not a guess. It is the intersection of every constraint and every real pattern in your research.

The First Accountant Must Fit This Exact Blueprint

You are not looking for a generic contabilista.
You are looking for the Operator Zero who can plug into your engine today.

Below is the composite profile built from the November 28 Accountant Report, the Parallel Intelligence Pack, the TaxDown Playbook, the Fiscal Calendar files, and the Master Pattern file.

I will show you what the accountant must be and why.

1. They must be a certified Portuguese accountant who works with freelancers

All research agrees on this requirement.

Why
Your entire intake, your red flags, your Fix Session product, and your compliance engine all revolve around freelancer rules.

This includes:
• Activity opening
• VAT threshold logic
• Quarterly VAT
• Quarterly Social Security declaration
• IRS Modelo 3 freelancers
• ATCUD
• Invoice regimes
• Simplified regime vs organized accounting


This accountant must already know these without needing education from you.

2. They must be responsive, tech friendly, and used to WhatsApp

The reports are clear: most accountants fail on communication and tech.

The Accountant Intelligence Pack states that the biggest predictor of a good partner is:
• Uses WhatsApp
• Replies within 24 hours
• Works in cloud tools
• Already handles remote clients


You must avoid accountants who:
• Use desktop-only programs
• Insist on in-person meetings
• Refuse to look at your Supabase report
• Refuse English communication

3. They must speak workable English

You do not need perfect English.
You need good enough English to handle:

• your foreign leads
• your diagnostic notes
• email back-and-forth
• VAT and IRS questions
• activity opening clarifications

The files repeatedly warn that communication breakdown is the number one reason foreigners fail in Portugal.
You solve this. The accountant must not introduce friction back into the system.

4. They must accept a defined role: filings only, not intake

Every file repeats the same structure.
Your role is the orchestrator.
Their role is the filer.

You handle:
• Intake
• Diagnostics
• Scoring
• Deadline logic
• Threshold checks
• Risk mapping
• Evidence packaging
• User communication until handoff
• User education

They handle:
• Giving confirmed answers
• Filing activity
• Filing VAT
• Filing Modelo 3
• Confirming VAT regimes
• Handling AT communication


If they push back on this role division, they cannot be your operator.

5. They must accept one condition: Worktugal owns triage

This is the structure that TaxDown, Taxfix, and Xolo use.
Your files are explicit: you must remain the front door.


This gives you:
• control
• user quality
• predictable workload
• structured handoff
• clean revenue split
• scaling ability

If an accountant demands full access to the user or wants to bypass you, they become a threat to the model.

6. They must agree to a simple, fixed revenue share

Research recommends a model like:

• You bring intake, leads, product, and clarity
• They do filings
• You take a percentage of monthly plans or one time Fix Sessions


The recommended range from your files is:
• 20 percent to 40 percent of monthly recurring
or
• fixed fee per Fix Session

You choose.

If the accountant refuses to work with revenue share, they are not a startup friendly partner.

7. They must be available for a small weekly batch of fixes

You do not need a high volume accountant.
You need an accountant willing to:

• handle 3 to 5 Fix Sessions per week
• handle activity openings frequently
• handle VAT registrations
• confirm red flag logic
• deliver within 3 to 5 days


If they cannot promise capacity, the partnership breaks.

8. They must respect timing rules

Your files show Portugal is timing driven.
The accountant must understand:

• quarterly cycles
• Social Security deadlines
• VAT cycles
• February 25 deadline
• seasonal shutdowns
• holiday backlogs


If the accountant does not operate on timing discipline, they will create user failures and destroy your trust funnel.

9. They must accept foreigners, migrants, digital nomads, and multi country cases

The Parallel research confirms this is the most underserved segment.
Most Portuguese accountants avoid them.


Your leads are exactly these people.

The accountant must be comfortable with:
• multiple income sources
• foreign income reporting
• crypto
• remote companies
• D8 visa holders
• multi residency narratives

If they say these cases are too complicated, they are not the right partner.

10. They must be predictable, not brilliant

You do not need a genius accountant.
You need an accountant who:

• follows rules
• follows deadlines
• follows process
• does not improvise
• does not disappear
• does not ghost
• does not miss VAT deadlines
• does not overcomplicate things


Predictability is more important than brilliance.

Your First Accountant Defined in One Sentence

A certified freelancer focused accountant who responds fast on WhatsApp, speaks workable English, accepts Worktugal as the intake owner, handles filings only, follows timing discipline, is comfortable with foreign clients, and agrees to a simple revenue share for 3 to 5 weekly fix sessions.

This is your Operator Zero.

Yes. We need to rebuild this form today.

Your current accountant application system is solid technically, very polished, and looks like a marketplace onboarding form.
But based on everything we know now from:

• The Accountant Partner Intelligence Pack
• The November 28 Freelancer Accountant Report
• The TaxDown de risked audit
• The Master Pattern file
• Your intake data
• Your revenue path
• The Eleven Rule Engine
• Your operator model

This form is no longer aligned with the business you are now running.

Now you need Operator Zero, not a general accountant applicant.

Below is a precise audit of what stays, what dies, and what must be rebuilt.

I cite from your uploaded Accountant Form document when needed.


1. The old form was designed for a marketplace

The current form assumes:

• Many accountants
• A broad network
• Loose specialization
• Slow review cycles
• 10 to 15 minute applications
• General purpose accounting portfolios
• Interviews and vetting like a traditional hiring pipeline


This no longer matches your strategic direction.

Your real need now:
One highly aligned accountant who integrates into your Eleven Rule Engine, accepts the Worktugal workflow, responds fast, handles filings, and fits the Portugal engine.

The form must screen for operator fit, not CV polish.

2. Your new filtering criteria demand a different form

From your research, the partner must meet the following:

• OCC certified or supervised
• Freelancer Category B specialist
• VAT specialist
• WhatsApp responsive
• Comfortable with foreigners and English
• Accepts your role as triage
• Accepts their role as filings only
• Understands timing rules
• Willing to do 3 to 5 Fix Sessions per week
• Comfortable with revenue share
• Good communication habits
• Understands remote workflows
• Does not demand direct access to your leads
• Predictable, reliable, low ego

The current form does NOT screen for these.

3. The current form collects irrelevant or weak-signaling data

Examples:
• Website
• Portfolio
• Typical hourly rate
• “Why Worktugal” motivational essay
• Bio narrative paragraph
• Link to LinkedIn


None of these tell you if they can:

• handle activity openings
• handle VAT transitions
• work with foreigners
• respond fast
• accept Worktugal’s structure
• manage timing deadlines
• deliver predictable filings

The entire structure must shift.

4. The new form must function as a stress test, not an application

Your Operator Zero must pass these filters:

A. Capability filters
• Can you open activity?
• Can you handle simplified regime?
• Are you familiar with VAT 125 percent rule?
• Can you run Modelo 3 for freelancers?
• Do you understand NISS for first 12 months?
• Can you handle remote worker cases?

B. Behavioral filters
• How quickly do you reply to clients?
• What tools do you use daily?
• Do you use WhatsApp for work?
• What is your filing rhythm?
• What is your communication rhythm?
• How many clients can you take weekly?

C. Structural filters
• Will you accept Worktugal as triage?
• Will you only handle filings, not intake?
• Are you open to revenue share?
• Can you deliver within timing windows?
• Can you work on your own timetable?

D. Red flag blockers
• Accountants who hate foreigners
• Accountants who avoid remote cases
• Accountants who insist on full control
• Accountants who ignore deadlines
• Accountants who slow lead cycles

The current form does NONE of this.

5. We need a new structure in four sections

Here is the corrected form architecture.

Section 1: Professional Identity

• Name
• Email
• WhatsApp
• OCC status
• Years of freelancer experience
• Years of handling foreign clients
• English fluency

Section 2: Technical Capabilities

Checkbox list with must answers:

Which of these do you actively handle?
• Activity opening for freelancers
• VAT exemption and VAT registration
• VAT quarterly filings
• IRS Modelo 3 for freelancers
• NISS first year rules
• Cross border income cases
• Crypto income
• Residency determination
• ATCUD registration

Add required scenario questions:
• What happens when a freelancer exceeds €15k mid year?
• How do you confirm VAT regime for a new client?
• What are the February 25 deadlines?

These questions filter 90 percent of applicants instantly.

Section 3: Behavioral and Operational Fit

Ask:

• How fast do you reply during working hours?
• Do you use WhatsApp with clients?
• What software do you use daily?
• How many cases per week can you take?
• Are you comfortable with Worktugal handling intake and diagnostics before sending you the case?
• Are you okay with handling filings only?

This forces them to accept the operation design.

Section 4: Partnership Terms

Ask:

• Are you open to a simple revenue share per case?
• Are you open to 3 to 5 Fix Sessions per week?
• Are you comfortable working with English speaking clients?
• Are you comfortable handling sensitive cross border cases?

Only green answers continue.

6. What stays from your old form

We keep:

• Resume upload
• OCC number upload
• Availability
• Submission via /join-accountants route
• Admin review panel


Everything else must be rewritten.

7. What to do today

We must rewrite the form into a new partner selection engine.

This matters because:

• Your business model depends on this first accountant
• Timing is tight
• You need compatibility, not CVs
• Your product is ready but partner is missing
• The Eleven Rule Engine demands a technical partner
• Your intake data shows real paid demand
• You need revenue this week
