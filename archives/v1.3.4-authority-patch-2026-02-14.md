# Thread Handover Protocol

## 1. Thread Overview
The session was triggered by a critical "Authority Bug" discovery: the platform was hardcoding 2025 tax deadlines in February 2026, causing a credibility fracture during an active email campaign. The primary goal was to transition the intelligence layer from "Static Documentation" to "Dynamic Authority."

The emotional and strategic driver was "Authority Defense." Outdated dates directly eroded user trust and suppressed conversion rates for the €49 Paid Compliance Review. There was an urgent need to verify current 2026 regulations and reflect that accuracy across all user touchpoints.

The outcome is a complete refactoring of the regulatory logic, now utilizing dynamic year-aware deadlines and real-time social proof (130+ leads). We integrated official legal citations and "Verified" badges to cement our position as a real-time regulatory engine. This matters because it directly removed the friction preventing warm leads from converting to paid customers.

## 2. Key Decisions Made
Technical, stack, automation, schema
• Decision: Refactored `taxCheckupEnhancements.ts` to auto-calculate deadlines based on the current system year.
• Impact: Permanently solves the "stale date" problem, ensuring the platform remains evergreen without manual code changes every year.
• Files or IDs: `src/utils/taxCheckupEnhancements.ts`.

• Decision: Implemented a "Verified against official sources" badge system.
• Impact: Adds a high-trust UI signal that communicates active monitoring of Portuguese law.
• Files or IDs: `CheckupResults.tsx`, `ModernHero.tsx`.

Strategic, ICP, monetization, positioning
• Decision: Transitioned landing page social proof ("Analysis of X+") to dynamic database-linked counts.
• Impact: Compounds authority automatically as lead volume grows (90+ became 130+).
• Proof or metric: 38 new leads and first ~€147 organic revenue captured in today's campaign.

Deferred or pending
• Item: Full Parallel.ai "Legal Pulse" automation (Supabase Cron).
• Blocker: Requires architectural setup of a regulatory config table to allow AI-driven date updates.
• Owner: AI Agent (Future Task).

## Operator Notes
Leverage has shifted from technical stability to "Verified Authority." The "Authority Bug" was a blessing in disguise as it forced us to build a more resilient, dynamic intelligence layer. Risk is now the gap between manual verification and automated "Legal Pulse." The next focus should be automating the verification date using the Parallel.ai API.

## Operator Take
We turned a credibility leak into a trust engine—authority is now a dynamic asset, not a static burden.
