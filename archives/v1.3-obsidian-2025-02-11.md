# Thread Handover Protocol

## 1. Thread Overview
**Context**: Comprehensive UI/UX redesign of the Worktugal application to the "Obsidian" dark theme (v1.2), alongside a rigorous content audit to enforce strict "sentence case" and correct all date references to the current year (2025).

**Scope**: 
*   **UI/UX**: Transformed `ContactPage`, `ContactSuccess`, `ModernHero`, `ModernComplianceReviewCTA`, `PaidReviewLanding`, `TaxCheckupForm`, `AccountingDeskLanding`, `PartnersPage`, and `Footer` to use the Obsidian design system (black backgrounds, white/5 borders, serif headings).
*   **Content**: Updated all SEO meta tags (title, description, og) across key landing pages to align with Behavioral OS and Solopreneur Engine principles. Reverted "2026" references to "2025" throughout the codebase and documentation.
*   **Ops**: Formalized the `prompts` folder as a Git submodule to resolve Cloudflare Pages build errors and created `sync-prompts.ps1` for automated management.

**Outcome**: A cohesive, high-authority dark-mode application that signals trust through consistent design and accurate temporal references (2025). Technical debt related to submodule management has been eliminated.

## 2. Key Decisions Made

**Technical, stack, automation, schema**
*   **Decision**: Formalized `prompts` directory as a Git submodule with `.gitmodules` configuration.
*   **Impact**: Resolves Cloudflare Pages build failures by ensuring the build environment can clone the necessary prompt assets.
*   **Files**: `.gitmodules`, `sync-prompts.ps1`, `.gitignore`.

**Strategic, ICP, monetization, positioning**
*   **Decision**: Enforced "Obsidian" design system (dark mode, serif headings, minimalist borders) as the default visual language.
*   **Impact**: Elevates brand perception to a premium, authority-driven service for high-value professionals.
*   **Proof**: User approval of "more powerful" aesthetic in `ContactPage` and `ModernHero` updates.

**Deferred or pending**
*   **Item**: Full functional testing of all forms in the new theme.
*   **Blocker**: None immediate, but requires user verification of end-to-end flows.

## 3. Assets Created

**Prompts and docs**
*   **Docs**: `README.md` (v1.3.0 update), `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `docs/TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md`.
*   **Prompts**: Updated `prompts/knowledge/obsidian-theme.md` (via sync).

**Code, SQL, scripts**
*   **Scripts**: `sync-prompts.ps1` (PowerShell script for automated submodule synchronization).
*   **Config**: `.gitmodules`.

**Components**
*   **Core UI**: `ContactPage.tsx`, `ContactSuccess.tsx`, `ModernHero.tsx`, `ModernComplianceReviewCTA.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`.
*   **Landing Pages**: `ModernHomePage.tsx`, `PaidReviewLanding.tsx`, `TaxCheckupForm.tsx`, `AccountingDeskLanding.tsx`, `PartnersPage.tsx`.

---

## 4. Pending or Next Steps

**Ops or system builds**
*   **Action**: Verify successful Cloudflare Pages deployment following the `.gitmodules` fix.
*   **Owner**: Dev / System.
*   **Dependency**: Cloudflare build pipeline.

**Growth or content**
*   **Action**: Monitor SEO performance and conversion rates on updated landing pages.
*   **Owner**: Growth Lead.
*   **Metric**: Organic traffic and form submission rates.

## Operator Notes
High leverage achieved by standardizing the design system and automating the submodule workflow. The "2025" date correction was critical for trust. Future work should focus on functional validation and expanding the Obsidian theme to any remaining edge pages.

## Operator Take
Obsidian theme and strict sentence case now define the platform's authority, backed by a stabilized 2025 timeline.
