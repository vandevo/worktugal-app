# Thread Handover Protocol

## 1. Thread Overview
Scope covers the v1.2 Pre-Launch Page Refresh, fixing critical conversion leaks in the free checkup funnel, and aligning copy with the Readyfile vision. Tech stack is React, TypeScript, and Supabase.

Drivers are the immediate start of an email marketing campaign, the need for cost-effective monetization of ICPs, and legal protection through consistent disclaimers.

Outcome is a fully refreshed user-facing experience (Homepage, Landing, Results, Success) with active CTAs to the paid review, standardized disclaimers, and seeded "compliance readiness" language.

## Operator Notes
The conversion funnel is now technically "sealed" from free checkup to paid review. The biggest risk is lead conversion rate from the email campaign. Next focus should be on the delivery side: finalizing the AI-assisted reports for the first paying customers.

## Operator Take
Value unlocked: Every visitor now has a clear, priced path to monetization, protected by automated legal guardrails.
