# Thread Handover Protocol v3.1

## 1. Thread Overview
The thread focused on the final standardization of the Obsidian v1.2 Design System across the Worktugal application. The primary scope included porting the contact and partnership intake flow to the new minimalist aesthetic and ensuring the entire codebase is synchronized with the current date (February 9, 2025).

The strategic driver was the elimination of "ghost" design elements and inaccurate timeline data (incorrectly set to 2026) that undermined the platform's authority. Correcting these dates across tax intelligence layers, UI badges, and documentation was critical for launch readiness.

The outcome is a visually unified frontend that adheres to the Obsidian v1.2 Cursor rules, with all regulatory guidance and marketing copy aligned to the 2025 tax year. This ensures a professional, high-fidelity experience for foreign freelancers and potential partners.

## 2. Key Decisions Made

Technical, stack, automation, schema
• Decision: Universal date correction from 2026 to 2025.
• Impact: Synchronized all tax filing deadlines (e.g., Feb 25 for 2024 expenses) and UI badges with reality.
• Files or IDs: src/utils/taxCheckupEnhancements.ts, README.md, src/components/accounting/CheckupHero.tsx

Strategic, ICP, monetization, positioning
• Decision: Redefined Hero feature as "Compliance Readiness Layer".
• Impact: Corrected the positioning to avoid premature claims of accountant verification while maintaining a powerful value prop.
• Proof or metric: Aligned with README.md mission statement.

Deferred or pending
• Item: ReadyFile v1 schema definition.
• Blocker: Market feedback from initial lead outreach.
• Owner: Van.

## Operator Notes
The session effectively "closed the loop" on the Obsidian UI redesign. The date correction was a critical "firewall" fix—having 2026 dates in a 2025 context would have destroyed trust immediately. The system is now ready for live traffic and manual outreach. Next focus must be 100% on conversion and feedback gathering from the 92 existing leads.

## Operator Take
The Obsidian redesign is now a standard, the timeline is fixed, and the platform is positioned as a professional gatekeeper ready for its first paying customers.
