# Thread Handover Protocol

## 1. Thread Overview
Scope, tech, funnels, ops, partners, events, finance:
Operational reframing of Worktugal from helper/translator toward the Quiet Gatekeeper identity. Focus on the compliance readiness funnel (v1.2 pre-launch refresh), Stripe product alignment, and Make.com automation copy refinement. Technical stack remains React, Supabase, Stripe, and Make.com.

Emotional or strategic drivers, survival pressure, leverage:
Transitioning from unpaid labor/explanation to gated value enforcement. Strategic goal is to move from proving value before payment to extracted commitment first. The leverage point is the existing inbound leads (92 checkup leads) and the AI-assisted research layer (Parallel.ai).

Outcome summary and why it matters:
Synchronized the codebase with the new product naming (Compliance Readiness Review) and secured clear, direct, human-paced communication templates for the automated delivery loop. This prevents conversion leaks and protects the operator's energy by enforcing boundaries early.

## Operator Notes
The thread successfully transitioned the project's posture from a "helper" to a "gatekeeper." The most critical asset is the updated communication protocol for the automated loop, which now sounds human but firm. The immediate focus must be the manual update to the Stripe dashboard to avoid checkout errors and launching the first batch of emails to validate the 49 EUR price gate.

## Operator Take
One mechanical inversion—commitment before value—turns a labor-intensive service into a scalable gatekeeper operation.
