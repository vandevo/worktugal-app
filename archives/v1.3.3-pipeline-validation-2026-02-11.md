# Thread Handover Protocol

## 1. Thread Overview
The session focused on finalizing the monetization pipeline for the Paid Compliance Review product. This involved validating the Stripe checkout flow through an end-to-end €1.00 internal test, refining the Obsidian design system across critical user-facing components, and enforcing editorial standards via the Sentence Case Protocol. The technical scope covered React components, Supabase RLS policies, PostgreSQL indexing, and Cloudflare deployment stability.

The primary driver was the shift from technical setup to operational cashflow readiness. Survival pressure stems from the need to validate one-time payments before further scaling. Leverage was found in optimizing database performance to handle incoming traffic and ensuring a professional, high-authority tone to build trust with high-intent leads.

The outcome is a fully validated, production-ready payment and fulfillment pipeline integrated with Make.com and Supabase. This matters because it removes the final technical blockers for the "Cashflow Defense" phase, allowing the business to focus entirely on outreach and sales.

## 2. Key Decisions Made
Technical, stack, automation, schema
• Decision: Implemented automated internal price ID override in live mode.
• Impact: Enables end-to-end production pipeline testing without affecting the main €49 product price.
• Files or IDs: `src/stripe-config.ts`, `VITE_STRIPE_PRICE_ID_INTERNAL_TEST`.

• Decision: Optimized Supabase RLS policies and added missing foreign key indexes.
• Impact: Drastically improves query performance and ensures data security as lead volume increases.
• Files or IDs: Migrations `fix_rls_performance_policies`, `add_missing_fk_indexes_performance_info`.

Strategic, ICP, monetization, positioning
• Decision: Enforced Sentence Case Enforcement Protocol across all UI text.
• Impact: Aligns brand voice with high-authority, professional positioning, removing "marketing-heavy" uppercase styles.
• Proof or metric: Applied to `PaidReviewLanding.tsx` and `PaidReviewIntakeForm.tsx`.

Deferred or pending
• Item: Revert live pricing to €49 by removing internal test environment variables.
• Blocker: Requires manual deletion of variables in Cloudflare dashboard by the user.
• Owner: User.

## Operator Notes
Leverage is now entirely in the hands of the human outreach layer. The technical gate is open, the pipeline is leak-proof, and the brand tone is authoritative. Risk is now "execution drag"—delaying outreach to the 7 HOT leads. Focus must remain on the 49 EUR validation before adding any new features or complexity.

## Operator Take
The pipe is laid, the water is tested, and the gate is ready—time to turn the handle on revenue.
